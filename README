Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

2. REQUIREMENTS

  This section outlines build requirements for different OS
  distributions. This may be out of date compared to the on-line
  requirements at

  <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Building>.

  As of ATS v7.0.0 and later, gcc 4.8.1 or later is required, since we now use
  and require the C++11 standard.

  Fedora / CentOS / RHEL:
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkgconfig
    perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker
    gcc/g++ or clang/clang++
    openssl-devel
    pcre-devel
    ncurses-devel and libcurl-devel(optional, needed for traffic_top)
    libcap-devel (optional, highly recommended)
    hwloc-devel (optional, highly recommended)
    flex (optional, needed for e.g. WCCP)

  Ubuntu / Debian
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
    libmodule-install-perl
    gcc/g++ or clang/clang++
    zlib1g-dev
    libssl-dev
    libpcre3-dev
    libcap-dev (optional, highly recommended)
    libhwloc-dev (optional, highly recommended)
    libncurses5-dev (optional, required for e.g.: traffic_top)
    libcurl4-openssl-dev (optional, required for e.g.: traffic_top)
    flex (optional, required for e.g. WCCP)

  Alpine Linux
    build-base
    libexecinfo-dev
    pcre-dev
    libressl-dev
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    linux-headers

  OSX (we recommend HomeBrew):
    autoconf
    automake
    pkg-config
    libtool
    openssl
    pcre

  FreeBSD
    devel/gmake
    devel/autoconf
    devel/automake
    devel/pkgconf
    devel/libtool
    security/openssl
    devel/pcre
    textproc/flex (optional, install newer version from ports, fix PATH)
    devel/hwloc (optional, highly recommended)

  OmniOS:
    developer/gcc46
    developer/build/gnu-make
    developer/build/autoconf
    developer/build/automake-111
    developer/build/libtool
    library/security/openssl
    library/pcre

3. Building from distribution

You can download the latest source code from the official Apache Traffic
Server site:

       https://trafficserver.apache.org/downloads

(or via the URL shortener: http://s.apache.org/uG). Once downloaded,
follow the instructions:

   tar xf trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable.tar.bz2
   cd trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makefiles
  make                   # execute the compile

This will build with a destination prefix of /usr/local. You can finish
the installation with

  sudo make install

4. BUILDING FROM GIT REPO

  mkdir -p ~/dev         # make yourself a development dir
  cd ~/dev               # enter your development dir
  git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repository
  cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout directory
  autoreconf -if         # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makefiles
  make                   # execute the compile

4b. Instructions for building on EC2
    NOTE: Alternately you may use the scripts under 'contrib' which will
          automate the install for trafficserver under EC2 which is
          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See 'README-EC2' for further details.

   # As root do the following when using Ubuntu
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repo
   cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure
   make

   # As root do the following when using Fedora Core 8 kernel
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repo
   cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure --disable-eventfd
   make

4c. Instructions for building on FreeBSD

   The only difference is how to run configure and make:

   MAKE=gmake ./configure # make sure that gmake is the make we use
   gmake

5. INSTALLATION

  DEFAULT DIR                        CONTENTS
  /usr/local/var/log/trafficserver   log files created at runtime
  /usr/local/var/trafficserver       runtime files
  /usr/local/etc/trafficserver       configuration files
  /usr/local/bin                     executable binaries
  /usr/local/libexec/trafficserver   plugins

6. CRYPTO NOTICE

  software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
  algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
  distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
  ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS
  Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object
