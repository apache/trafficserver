Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

3. Building from distribution

You can download the latest source code from the official Apache Traffic
Server site:

       http://trafficserver.apache.org/downloads

(or via the URL shortener: http://s.apache.org/uG). Once downloaded,
follow the instructions:

   tar xf trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable.tar.bz2
   cd trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makefiles
  make                   # execute the compile

This will build with a destination prefix of /usr/local. You can finish
the installation with

  sudo make install

4. BUILDING FROM GIT REPO

  mkdir -p ~/dev         # make yourself a development dir
  cd ~/dev               # enter your development dir
  git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repo
  cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout dir
  autoreconf -if         # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makefiles
  make                   # execute the compile

4b. Instructions for building on EC2
    NOTE: Alternately you may use the scripts under 'contrib' which will
          automate the install for trafficserver under EC2 which is
          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See 'README-EC2' for further details.

   # As root do the following when using Ubuntu
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repo
   cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure
   make

   # As root do the following when using Fedora Core 8 kernel
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   git clone ...          # get the source code from ASF Git repo
   cd trafficserver       # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure --disable-eventfd
   make

4c. Instructions for building on FreeBSD

   The only difference is how to run configure and make:

   MAKE=gmake ./configure # make sure that gmake is the make we use
   gmake

5. INSTALLATION

  DEFAULT DIR                        CONTENTS
  /usr/local/var/log/trafficserver   log files created at runtime
  /usr/local/var/trafficserver       runtime files
