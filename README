Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

2. REQUIREMENTS
    This section outlines different OS distributions

  Fedora 11,12:
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    gcc-c++
    glibc-devel
    openssl-devel
    tcl-devel
    expat-devel
    sqlite-devel (or optionally, db4-devel)
    pcre

  Fedora 8 EC2 (Kernel: 2.6.21.7-2.ec2.v1.2.fc8xen):
    You must either upgrade sqlite to >= 3.5 or use db4-devel.
    We recommend that you when dealing with EC2 FC8 to just use db4-devel.
    FC8 on EC2 requires unique configure declarations, please see that section
    below. 

    NOTE: Alternately you may use the install scripts in 'contrib' which 
          automate this or use the pre-built public Fedora Core 8 EC2 AMI 
          with ATS installed. Both of which are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
          See 'README-EC2' for further details.

    Install these packages:
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    gcc-c++
    glibc-devel
    openssl-devel
    tcl-devel
    expat-devel
    db4-devel
    pcre

  Ubuntu 8.04,8.10,9.10:
    autoconf 
    automake
    libtool 
    g++ 
    libssl-dev 
    tcl-dev 
    expat 
    libexpat-dev 
    libsqlite3-dev (or optionally, libdb-dev)
    libpcre3-dev

  Ubuntu EC2 9.10:
    NOTE: Alternately you may use the install scripts in 'contrib' which 
          automate this or use the pre-built public Ubuntu EC2 AMI with 
          ATS installed. Both of which are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
          See 'README-EC2' for further details.

    Install these packages:
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    g++
    libssl-dev
    tcl-dev
    expat
    libexpat-dev
    libsqlite3-dev (or optionally, libdb-dev)
    libpcre3-dev

  FreeBSD 7.2,8.0:
    GCC 4.2.1 compiler suite
    autoconf 
    automake
    libtool
    tcl
    expat
    openssl
    pcre
    sqlite3 (or optionally, db4)

  OpenSolaris osol0906:
    GCC 4.3.2 compiler suite (dev collection)
    autoconf 
    automake
    libtool
    tcl
    expat
    openssl
    pcre
    sqlite3 (or optionally, db4)

    GCC 4.2.4 compiler suite (ports collection)
    autoconf 
    automake
    libtool
    tcl
    expat
    openssl
    pcre
    sqlite3 (or optionally, db4)

For using sqlite3, we only support v3.5 or later (basically, we require the v2 APIs).


3. BUILDING FROM SVN REPO

  mkdir -p ~/dev         # make yourself a development dir
  cd ~/dev               # enter your development dir
  svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
  cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
  autoreconf -i          # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makfiles
  make                   # execute the compile

3b. Instructions for building on EC2
    NOTE: Alternately you may use the scripts under 'contrib' which will 
          automate the install for trafficserver under EC2 which is 
          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See 'README-EC2' for further details.

   # As root do the following when using Ubuntu
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
   cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure
   make

   # As root do the following when using Fedora Core 8 kernel
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
   cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure --without-sqlite3 --with-libdb --disable-eventfd
   make
