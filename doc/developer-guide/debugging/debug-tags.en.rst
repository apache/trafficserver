Debug Tags
**********

Use the API macro
``TSDbg(ctlptr, const char *format_str, ...)`` to add
traces in your plugin. In this macro:

-  ``ctlptr`` is the Traffic Server parameter that enables Traffic Server
   to print out ``format_str``.  It is returned by ``TSDbgCtlCreate()``.

-  ``...`` are variables for ``format_str`` in the standard ``printf``
   style.

``void TSDbgCtlCreate (const char *tag)`` returns a (const) pointer to
``TSDbgCtl``.  The ``TSDbgCtl`` control is enabled when debug output is
enabled globally by configuaration, and ``tag`` matches a configured
regular expression.

The deprecated API
``void TSDebug (const char *tag, const char *format_str, ...)`` also
outputs traces.  In this API:

-  ``tag`` is the Traffic Server parameter that enables Traffic Server
   to print out ``format_str``

-  ``...`` are variables for ``format_str`` in the standard ``printf``
   style.

Use of ``TSDebug()`` causes trace output to have a more negative impact
on proxy throughput.

Run Traffic Server with the ``-Ttag`` option. For example, if the tag is
``my-plugin``, then the debug output goes to ``traffic.out.``\ See
below:

::

       traffic_server -T"my-plugin"

Sets the following variables in :file:`records.config` (in the Traffic Server
``config`` directory):

::

       CONFIG proxy.config.diags.debug.enabled INT 1
       CONFIG proxy.config.diags.debug.tags STRING debug-tag-name

(Performance will be better if ``enabled`` is set to 3 rather than 1, but,
using 3, output from ``TSDebug()`` will not be enabled, only from ``TSDbg()``.)
In this case, debug output goes to ``traffic.out``.

Example:

.. code-block:: c

       static TSDbgCtl const *my_dbg_ctl; // Non-local variable.
       ...
       my_dbg_ctl = TSDbgCtlCreate("my-plugin"); // In TSPluginInit() or TSRemapInit().
       ...
       TSDbg(my_dbg_ctl, "Starting my-plugin at %d", the_time);
       ...
       TSDbg(my_dbg_ctl, "Later on in my-plugin");


The statement ``"Starting my-plugin at <time>"`` appears whenever you
run Traffic Server with the ``my-plugin`` tag:

::

       traffic_server -T"my-plugin"

If your plugin is a C++ plugin, the above example can be written as:

.. code-block:: cpp

       static auto my_dbg_ctl = TSDbgCtlCreate("my-plugin"); // Non-local variable.
       ...
       TSDbg(my_dbg_ctl, "Starting my-plugin at %d", the_time);
       ...
       TSDbg(my_dbg_ctl, "Later on in my-plugin");

Other Useful Internal Debug Tags
================================

Embedded in the base Traffic Server code are many debug tags for
internal debugging purposes. These can also be used to follow Traffic
Server behavior for testing and analysis.

The debug tag setting (``-T`` and ``proxy.config.diags.debug.tags``) is a
anchored regular expression (PCRE) against which the tag for a specific debug
message is matched. This means the value "http" matches debug messages
with the tag "http" but also "http\_seq" and "http\_trans". If you want
multiple tags then use a pipe symbol to separate the tags. For example
"http\_tproxy\|dns\|hostdb" will match any of the message tags
"http\_tproxy", "dns", "hostdb", or "dns\_srv" (but not "http\_trans"
nor "splitdns").

Some of the useful HTTP debug tags are:

-  ``http_hdrs`` - traces all incoming and outgoing HTTP headers.

-  ``http_trans`` - traces actions in an HTTP transaction.

-  ``http_seq`` - traces the sequence of the HTTP state machine.

-  ``http_tproxy`` - transparency related HTTP events

-  ``dns`` - DNS operations

-  ``hostdb`` - Host name lookup

-  ``iocore_net`` - Socket and low level IO (very voluminous)

-  ``socket`` - socket operations

-  ``ssl`` - SSL related events

-  ``cache`` - Cache operations (many subtags, examine the output to
   narrow the tag set)

-  ``cache_update`` - Cache updates including writes

-  ``cache_read`` - Cache read events.

-  ``dir_probe`` - Cache searches.

-  ``sdk`` - gives some warning concerning API usage.
