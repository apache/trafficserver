Crypto
******

Sometimes doing cryptographic operations can be useful in a Cript. Cripts provides
a foundation for such tasks, providing hashing, encryption and encoding/decoding.

.. note::
   This is still very much work in progress, and thus far we've only added the most
   basic of cryptographic operations. More will be added as needed.

.. _cripts-misc-crypto-hash:

Hash
====

=================================   ===============================================================
Object                              Description
=================================   ===============================================================
``cripts::Crypto::MD5``             MD5 hashing.
``cripts::Crypto::SHA256``          SHA256 hashing.
``cripts::Crypto::SHA512``          SHA512 hashing.
``cripts::Crypto::HMAC::SHA256``    HMAC-SHA256 hashing.
=================================   ===============================================================

These objects all provide a ``Encode()`` and ``Decode()`` method, to hash and unhash strings.
Examples:

.. code-block:: cpp

   do_remap()
   {
     CDebug("SHA256 = {}", cripts::Crypto::SHA256::Encode("Hello World"));
   }

.. _cripts-misc-crypto-encryption:

Encryption
==========

Currently only one encryption object is provides, for AES256. This object provides
``Encrypt()`` and ``Decrypt()`` methods. A ``Hex()`` method is also provided to retrieve
the encrypted data as a hex string. For encrypting data in chunks, a ``Finalize()`` method
is provided to retrieve the final encrypted data.

=================================   ===============================================================
Object                              Description
=================================   ===============================================================
``cripts::Crypto::AES256``          AES256 encryption and decryption.
=================================   ===============================================================

.. _cripts-misc-crypto-encoding:

Encoding
========

Finally, for convenience, Cripts provides a ``Base64`` object for encoding and decoding, as well
as a URL escaping object, ``Escape``.

=================================   ===============================================================
Object                              Description
=================================   ===============================================================
``cripts::Crypto::Base64``          Methods for Base64 encoding.
``cripts::Crypto::Escape``          Methods for URL escaping.
=================================   ===============================================================

These objects all provide a ``Encode()`` and ``Decode()`` method, to encode and decode strings.
