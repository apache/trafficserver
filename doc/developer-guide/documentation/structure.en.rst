Structure
*********

The |ATS| documentation is presented as a single manual, sub-divided into the
following sections:

Preface
    The introductory section to the manual as a whole, with a brief exposition
    on |TS| and its general role in a network and application infrastructure.
    The typographic conventions used in the manual should be covered here to
    ease readers' comprehension of the following sections, as well as pointers
    to additional resources available outside of the manual.

Getting Started
    Aimed at administrators and developers new to |TS| who wish to install and
    configure a |TS| instance in the least amount of time necessary, without
    delving into the full featureset or the internals of the |TS| architecture.

Administrator's Guide
    Provides in-depth coverage of all |TS| features and configurations for use
    by administrators responsible for installing, configuring, and maintaining
    |TS| instances. Troubleshooting, performance tuning, and plugin usage should
    all be covered in this section of the manual.

Developer's Guide
    Documentation of internal |TS| architecture as well as guides on plugin
    development and debugging are presented in this section.

Appendices
    Glossary, common references to both administrator and developer guides (such
    as status code tables and command line utility usage), frequently asked
    questions, and errata should all be located in this final section of the
    manual.

Within each top-level section, a short introduction should be provided to the
content of that section, as well as a brief note on the intended audience. A
very high level treatment of each chapter should be presented to allow readers
to more easily locate the most relevant chapters for their current needs.
