|RST| and Sphinx
****************

The |TS| documentation source files are written using |RST| (RST) markup. This
is a plain-text format intended to be easily readable both in its source and
final rendered forms. While not entirely dissimilar to other plain text markup
formats like Markdown, RST provides additional functionality for defining
internal links between documents, producing tables of contents, and indices.
Additionally, RST works in hand with Sphinx for providing advanced features
such as markup domains, of which this documenentation makes extensive use.

Both |RST| and Sphinx have official documentation resources which detail their
full capabilities and all markup options, as well as methods of extending them
with custom markup. This section will explain the most common markup features
used, but the following resources may be consulted for further details.

- `reStructuredText Markup Specification <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_

- `Sphinx Documentation Generator <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
