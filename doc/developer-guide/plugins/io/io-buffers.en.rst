IO Buffers
**********

The IO buffer data structure is the building block of the vconnection
abstraction. An **IO buffer** (``TSIOBuffer``) is composed of a list of
buffer blocks that point to buffer data. Both the buffer block
(``TSIOBufferBlock``) and buffer data (``TSIOBufferData``) data
structures are reference-counted, so they can reside in multiple buffers
at the same time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from
one IO buffer to another via :c:func:`TSIOBufferCopy`, since Traffic Server
must only copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately (and
doesn't actually copy any data).

The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple
readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each other,
they manipulate IO buffers through the ``TSIOBufferReader`` data
structure. Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no
corresponding ``TSIOBufferWriter`` data structure. The writer simply
modifies the IO buffer directly. To see an example that illustrates how
to use IOBuffers, refer to the sample code in the description of
:c:func:`TSIOBufferBlockReadStart`.

Additional information about IO buffer functions:

-  The ``TSIOBufferReader`` data structure tracks how much data in
   ``TSIOBuffer`` has been read. It has an offset number of bytes that
   is the current start point of a particular buffer reader (for every
   read operation on an ``TSIOBuffer``, you must allocate an
   ``TSIOBufferReader``).

-  Bytes that have already been read may not necessarily be freed within
   the ``TSIOBuffer``. To consume bytes that have been read, you must
   call :c:func:`TSIOBufferReaderConsume`.
