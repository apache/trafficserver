Net Vconnections
****************

A **network vconnection** (or *netvconnection*) is a wrapper
around a TCP socket that enables the socket to work within the Traffic
Server vconnection framework. See
:ref:`vconnections <sdk-vconnections>` for more information about
the Traffic Server abstraction for doing asynchronous IO.

The netvconnection functions are listed below:

-  :c:func:`TSNetAccept`
-  :c:func:`TSNetConnect`
