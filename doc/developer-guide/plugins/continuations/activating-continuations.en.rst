Activating Continuations
************************

Continuations are activated when they receive an event or by
``TSContScheduleOnPool`` (which schedules a continuation to receive an event).
Continuations might receive an event because:

-  Your plugin calls ``TSContCall``

-  The Traffic Server HTTP state machine sends an event corresponding to
   a particular HTTP hook

-  A Traffic Server IO processor (such as a cache processor or net
   processor) is letting a continuation know there is data (cache or
   network) available to read or write. These callbacks are a result of
   using functions such ``TSVConnRead``/``Write`` or
   ``TSCacheRead``/``Write``
