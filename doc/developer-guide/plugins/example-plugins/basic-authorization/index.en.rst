Basic Authorization Plugin
**************************

The sample basic authorization plugin, ``basic-auth.c``, checks for
basic HTTP proxy authorization. In HTTP basic proxy authorization,
client user names and passwords are contained in the
``Proxy-Authorization`` header. The password is encoded using base64
encoding. The plugin checks all incoming requests for the authorization
header, user name, and password. If the plugin does not find all of the
these, then it reenables with an error (effectively stopping the
transaction) and adds a transaction hook to the send response header
event.

Creating the Plugin's Parent Continuation and Global Hook
=========================================================

The parent continuation and global hook are created as follows:

``TSHttpHookAdd (TS_HTTP_OS_DNS_HOOK, TSContCreate (auth_plugin, NULL));``
