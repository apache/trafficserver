Sample Source Code
******************

.. _blacklist-1.c:

blacklist_1.c
-------------

The sample blacklisting plugin included in the Traffic Server SDK is
``blacklist_1.c``. This plugin checks every incoming HTTP client request
against a list of blacklisted web sites. If the client requests a
blacklisted site, then the plugin returns an ``Access forbidden``
message to the client.

This plugin illustrates:

-  An HTTP transaction extension

-  How to examine HTTP request headers

-  How to use the logging interface

-  How to use the plugin configuration management interface
