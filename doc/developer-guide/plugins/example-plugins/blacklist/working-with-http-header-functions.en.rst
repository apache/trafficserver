Working with HTTP Header Functions
**********************************

The Blacklist plugin examines the host header in every client
transaction. This is done in the ``handle_dns`` routine, using
``TSHttpTxnClientReqGet``, ``TSHttpHdrUrlGet``, and ``TSUrlHostGet``.

.. code-block:: c

   static void
   handle_dns (TSHttpTxn txnp, TSCont contp)
   {
   TSMBuffer bufp;
   TSMLoc hdr_loc;
   TSMLoc url_loc;
   const char *host;
   int i;
   int host_length;

   if (TSHttpTxnClientReqGet(txnp, &bufp, &hdr_loc) != TS_SUCCESS) {
      TSError("[blacklist] Couldn't retrieve client request header");
      goto done;
   }

   if (TSHttpHdrUrlGet(bufp, hdr_loc, &url_loc) != TS_SUCCESS) {
      TSError("[blacklist] Couldn't retrieve request url");
      TSHandleMLocRelease(bufp, TS_NULL_MLOC, hdr_loc);
      goto done;
   }

   host = TSUrlHostGet(bufp, url_loc, &host_length);
   if (!host) {
      TSError("[blacklist] couldn't retrieve request hostname");
      TSHandleMLocRelease(bufp, hdr_loc, url_loc);
      TSHandleMLocRelease(bufp, TS_NULL_MLOC, hdr_loc);
      goto done;
   }

To access the host header, the plugin must first get the client request,
retrieve the URL portion, and then obtain the host header. See
:ref:`developer-plugins-http-headers` for more information about these calls.
See :ref:`developer-plugins-http-headers-marshal-buffers`
for guidelines on using ``TSHandleMLocRelease``.
