The Traffic Server API enables you to create plugins, using the C
programming language, that customize the behavior of your Traffic Server
installation. This chapter contains the following sections:

-  `Understanding Traffic Server Plugins`_ -- a brief introduction to plugins.

-  :ref:`developer-plugins-getting-started-simple-plugin` -- walks through
   compiling and loading an example ``hello world`` plugin.

-  :ref:`developer-plugins-getting-started-registration` -- shows
   you how to register your plugin and make sure it's compatible with the
   version of Traffic Server you're using.

-  :ref:`developer-plugins-getting-started-naming` -- outlines Traffic
   Server API naming conventions. For guidelines on creating plugin
   source code, see :ref:`developer-plugins-introduction`.

Understanding Traffic Server Plugins
====================================

Traffic Server enables sophisticated caching and processing of
web-related traffic, such as DNS and HTTP requests and responses.

Traffic Server itself consists of an event-driven loop that can be
simplified as follows:

.. code-block:: c

   for (;;) {
      event = get_next_event();
      handle_event (event);
   }

The Role of Plugins
-------------------

You compile your plugin source code to create a shared library that
Traffic Server loads when it is started. Your plugin contains callback
functions that are registered for specific Traffic Server events. When
Traffic Server needs to process an event, it invokes any and all
call-back functions you've registered for that event type.

.. caution::

   Since plugins add object code to Traffic Server, programming errors in a
   plugin can have serious implications. Bugs in your plugin, such as an
   out-of-range pointer, can cause Traffic Server processes to crash and
   may ultimately result in unpredictable behavior.

Possible Uses for Plugins
-------------------------

Possible uses for plugins include the following:

-  HTTP processing: plugins can filter, blacklist, authorize users,
   transform content

-  Protocol support: plugins can enable Traffic Server to proxy-cache
   new protocol content

Some examples of plugins include:

-  **Blacklisting plugin**: denies attempts to access web sites that are
   off-limits.

-  **Append transform plugin**: adds text to HTTP response content.

-  **Image conversion plugin**: transforms JPEG images to GIF images.

-  **Compression plugin**: sends response content to a compression
   server that compresses the data (alternatively, a compression library
   local to the Traffic Server host machine could do the compression).

-  **Authorization plugin**: checks a user's permissions to access
   particular web sites. The plugin could consult a local authorization
   program or send queries to an authorization server.

-  **A plugin that gathers client information** from request headers and
   enters this information in a database.

-  **Protocol plugin**: listens for specific protocol requests on a
   designated port and then uses Traffic Server's proxy server & cache
   to serve client requests.

The figure below, :ref:`possibleTSplugins`, illustrates several types of plugins.

**Possible Traffic Server Plugins**

   Possible Traffic Server Plugins

You can find basic examples for many plugins in the SDK sample code:

-  ``append_transform.c`` adds text from a specified file to HTTP/text
   responses. This plugin is explained in
   :ref:`developer-plugins-http-transformations-append`

-  The compression plugin in the figure communicates with the server
   that actually does the compression. The ``server-transform.c`` plugin
   shows how to open a connection to a transformation server, have the
   server do the transformation, and send transformed data back to the
   client. Although the transformation is null in
   ``server-transform.c``, a compression or image translation plugin
   could be implemented in a similar way.

-  ``basic_auth.c`` performs basic HTTP proxy authorization.

-  ``blacklist_1.c`` reads blacklisted servers from a configuration file
   and denies client access to these servers. This plugin is explained
   in :ref:`developer-plugins-examples-blacklist`.

Plugin Loading
--------------

When Traffic Server is first started, it consults the ``plugin.config``
file to determine the names of all shared plugin libraries that need to
be loaded. The ``plugin.config`` file also defines arguments that are to
be passed to each plugin's initialization function, ``TSPluginInit``.
The :file:`records.config` file defines the path to each plugin shared
library, as described in :ref:`specify-the-plugins-location`.

.. note:: The path for each of these files is *<root_dir>*\ ``/config/``, where *<root_dir>* is where you installed Traffic Server.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The sample ``plugin.config`` file below contains a comment line, a blank
line, and two plugin configurations:

::

    # This is a comment line.

    my-plugin.so junk.example.com trash.example.org garbage.example.edu
    some-plugin.so arg1 arg2 $proxy.config.http.cache.on

Each plugin configuration in the ``plugin.config`` file resembles a UNIX
or DOS shell command; each line in ``plugin.config`` cannot exceed 1023
characters.

The first plugin configuration is for a plugin named ``my-plugin.so``.
It contains three arguments that are to be passed to that plugin's
initialization routine. The second configuration is for a plugin named
``some-plugin.so``; it contains three arguments. The last argument,
*``$proxy.config.http.cache.on``*, is actually a configuration variable.
Traffic Server will look up the specified configuration variable and
substitute its value.

Plugins with global variables should not appear more than once in
``plugin.config``. For example, if you enter:

::

    add_header.so header1
    add_header.so header2

then the second global variable, ``header2``, will be used for both
instances. A simple workaround is to give different names to different
instances of the same plugin. For example:

::

    cp add_header.so add_header1.so
    cp add_header.so add_header2.so

These entries will produce the desired result below:

::

    add_header1.so header1
    add_header2.so header2

Configuration File Rules
------------------------

-  Comment lines begin with **#** and continue to the end of the line.

-  Blank lines are ignored.

-  Plugins are loaded and initialized by Traffic Server in the order
   they appear in the ``plugin.config`` file.

Plugin Initialization
---------------------

Each plugin must define an initialization function named
``TSPluginInit`` that Traffic Server invokes when the plugin is loaded.
The ``TSPluginInit`` function is commonly used to read configuration
information and register hooks for event notification.

The ``TSPluginInit`` function has two arguments:

-  The ``argc`` argument represents the number of arguments defined in
   the ``plugin.config`` file for that particular plugin

-  The ``argv`` argument is an array of pointers to the actual arguments
   defined in the ``plugin.config`` file for that plugin

See :c:func:`TSPluginInit` for details about ``TSPluginInit``.
