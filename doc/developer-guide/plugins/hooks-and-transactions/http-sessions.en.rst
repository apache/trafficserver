HTTP Sessions
*************

An **HTTP session** is an object that is defined for the lifetime of a
client's TCP session. The Traffic Server API enables you to add a global
hook to the start or end of an HTTP session, as well as add session
hooks that call back your plugin for every transaction within a given
session. When a client connects to Traffic Server, it opens up a TCP
connection and sends one or more HTTP requests. An individual request
and its response comprise the HTTP transaction. The **HTTP session**
begins when the client opens the connection and ends when the connection
closes.

The HTTP session hooks are:

-  ``TS_HTTP_SSN_START_HOOK`` Called when an HTTP session is started (a
   session starts when a client connects to Traffic Server). This hook
   must be added as a global hook.

-  ``TS_HTTP_SSN_CLOSE_HOOK`` Called when an HTTP session ends (a
   session ends when the client connection is closed). This hook must be
   added as a global hook.

Use the session hooks to get a handle to a session (an ``TSHttpSsn``
object). If you want your plugin to be called back for each transaction
within the session, then use ``TSHttpSsnHookAdd``.

**Note:** you must reenable the session with ``TSHttpSsnReenable`` after
processing a session hook.

The session hook functions are listed below:

-  :c:func:`TSHttpSsnHookAdd`
-  :c:func:`TSHttpSsnReenable`
