Plugin Configuration
********************

The functions discussed in this section do not examine or modify |TS|
configuration variables. To examine |TS| configuration and statistics
variables, see :ref:`developer-plugins-management-settings-and-statistics`.

The collection of ``TSConfig*`` functions are designed to provide a fast and
efficient mechanism for accessing and changing global configuration information
within a plugin. Such a mechanism is simple enough to provide in a
single-threaded program, but the translation to a multi-threaded program such
as |TS| is difficult. A common technique is to have a single mutex protect the
global configuration information; however, the problem with this solution is
that a single mutex becomes a performance bottleneck very quickly.

These functions define an interface to storing and retrieving an opaque data
pointer. Internally, |TS| maintains reference count information about the data
pointer so that a call to :c:func:`TSConfigSet` will not disturb another thread
using the current data pointer. The philosophy is that once a user has a hold
of the configuration pointer, it is okay for it to be used even if the
configuration changes. All that a user typically wants is a non-changing
snapshot of the configuration. You should use :c:func:`TSConfigSet` for all
global data updates.

Here's how the interface works:

.. code-block:: c

    /* Assume that you have previously defined a plugin configuration
     * data structure named ConfigData, along with its constructor
     * plugin_config_allocator () and its destructor
     * plugin_config_destructor (ConfigData *data)
     */
    ConfigData *plugin_config;

    /* You will need to assign plugin_config a unique identifier of type
     * unsigned int. It is important to initialize this identifier to zero
     * (see the documentation of the  function).
     */
    static unsigned int   my_id = 0;

    /* You will need an TSConfig pointer to access a snapshot of the
     * current plugin_config.
     */
    TSConfig config_ptr;

    /* Initialize plugin_config. */
    plugin_config = plugin_config_allocator();

    /* Assign plugin_config an identifier using TSConfigSet. */
    my_id = TSConfigSet (my_id, plugin_config, plugin_config_destructor);

    /* Get a snapshot of the current configuration using TSConfigGet. */
    config_ptr = TSConfigGet (my_id);

    /* With an TSConfig pointer to the current configuration, you can
     * retrieve the configuration's current data using TSConfigDataGet.
     */
    plugin_config = (ConfigData*) TSConfigDataGet (config_ptr);

    /* Do something with plugin_config here. */

    /* When you are done with retrieving or modifying the plugin data, you
     * release the pointers to the data with a call to TSConfigRelease.
     */
    TSConfigRelease (my_id, config_ptr);

    /* Any time you want to modify plugin_config, you must repeat these
     * steps, starting with
     * my_id = TSConfigSet (my_id,plugin_config, plugin_config_destructor);
     * and continuing up to TSConfigRelease.
     */

The configuration functions are:

-  :c:func:`TSConfigDataGet`

-  :c:func:`TSConfigGet`

-  :c:func:`TSConfigRelease`

-  :c:func:`TSConfigSet`
