TSSslServerContextCreate
************************

Traffic Server TLS server context creation.

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSSslContext TSSslServerContextCreate(TSSslX509 *cert, char *certname)
.. function:: void TSSslContextDestroy(TSSslContext ctx)

Description
===========

:func:`TSSslServerContextCreate` creates a new TLS server context. The context
is configured using the TLS settings specified in :file:`records.config`. The user can pass certificate object(:type:`TSSslX509` :arg:`cert`
and certname (:code:`const char*` :arg:`certname`) optionally.
This function sets the certificate status callback and initializes ocsp stapling data if :arg:`cert` and :arg:`certname` is provided and ocsp is enabled globally.
:func:`TSSslServerContextCreate` returns ``nullptr`` on failure.

:func:`TSSslContextDestroy` destroys a TLS context created by
:func:`TSSslServerContextCreate`. If :arg:`ctx` is ``nullptr`` no operation is
performed.

Type
====

.. type:: TSSslContext

	The SSL context object. This is an opaque type that can be cast to
	the underlying SSL library type (:code:`SSL_CTX *` for the OpenSSL library).
