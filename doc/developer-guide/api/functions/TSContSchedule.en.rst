TSContSchedule
**************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: TSAction TSContSchedule(TSCont contp, TSHRTime timeout)

Description
===========

Schedules :arg:`contp` to run :arg:`delay` milliseconds in the future. This is approximate. The delay
will be at least :arg:`delay` but possibly more. Resolutions finer than roughly 5 milliseconds will
not be effective. :arg:`contp` is required to have a mutex, which is provided to
:func:`TSContCreate`.

The return value can be used to cancel the scheduled event via :func:`TSActionCancel`. This is
effective until the continuation :arg:`contp` is being dispatched. However, if it is scheduled on
another thread this can be problematic to be correctly timed. The return value can be checked with
:func:`TSActionDone` to see if the continuation ran before the return, which is possible if
:arg:`timeout` is `0`. Returns ``nullptr`` if thread affinity was cleared.

Note that the TSContSchedule() family of API shall only be called from an ATS EThread.
Calling it from raw non-EThreads can result in unpredictable behavior.
