TSHttpHdrCopy
*************

Copies the contents of the HTTP header located at :arg:`src_loc` within
:arg:`src_bufp` to the HTTP header located at :arg:`dest_loc` within
:arg:`dest_bufp`.

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpHdrCopy(TSMBuffer dest_bufp, TSMLoc dest_offset, TSMBuffer src_bufp, TSMLoc src_offset)

Description
===========

:c:func:`TSHttpHdrCopy` works correctly even if :arg:`src_bufp` and :arg:`dest_bufp`
point to different :ref:`developer-plugins-http-headers-marshal-buffers`. Make
sure that you create the destination HTTP header before copying into it.

.. note::

   :c:func:`TSHttpHdrCopy` appends the port number to the domain of
   the URL portion of the header. For example, a copy of
   http://www.example.com appears as http://www.example.com:80 in the
   destination buffer.
