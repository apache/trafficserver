TSMimeHdrFieldGet
*****************

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSMLoc TSMimeHdrFieldGet(TSMBuffer bufp, TSMLoc hdr, int idx)

Description
===========

Retrieves the location of a specified MIME field within the MIME
header located at :arg:`hdr_loc` within :arg:`bufp`.

The :arg:`idx` parameter specifies which field to retrieve.  The fields are
numbered from :literal:`0` to ``TSMimeHdrFieldsCount(bufp, hdr_loc)`` - 1.  If
:arg:`idx` does not lie within that range then :c:type:`TSMimeHdrFieldGet`
returns :literal:`0`.  Release the returned handle with a call to
:c:type:`TSHandleMLocRelease`.
