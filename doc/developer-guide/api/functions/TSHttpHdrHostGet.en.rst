TSHttpHdrHostGet
****************

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: const char* TSHttpHdrHostGet(TSMBuffer bufp, TSMLoc offset, int * length)

Description
===========

Get the host for the request. :arg:`bufp` and :arg:`offset` must reference an
HTTP request header. A pointer to the host is returned and the length is stored
in the ``int`` pointed at by :arg:`length`. Note the returned text may not
be null terminated. The URL in the request is checked first then the ``Host``
header field.

.. note::

   This is much faster than calling :c:func:`TSHttpTxnEffectiveUrlStringGet` and
   extracting the host from the result.
