===================

Synopsis
--------

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. c:function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnInfoIntGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSHttpTxnInfoKey key, TSMgmtInt * value)

Description
-----------

:c:func:`TSHttpTxnInfoIntGet` returns arbitrary integer-typed info about a transaction as defined in
:c:type:`TSHttpTxnInfoKey`. The API will be part of a generic API umbrella that can support returning
arbitrary info about a transaction using custom log tags. It works on multiple hooks depending on the
requested info. For example, cache related info may be available only at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook.

The :c:type:`TSHttpTxnInfoKey` currently supports the below integer-based info about a transaction

.. c:type:: TSHttpTxnInfoKey

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_HIT_RAM

      This info is available at or after :c:member:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. A value of :literal:`1` indicates that the response
      is returned from RAM cache. A value of :literal:`0` indicates otherwise.

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_COMPRESSED_IN_RAM

      This info is available at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. A value of 1 indicates that the response
      is returned from RAM cache and is compressed. A value of 0 indicates otherwise.

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_HIT_RWW

      This info is available at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. A value of 1 indicates that the response
      is returned via Read-While-Writer functionality. A value of 0 indicates otherwise.

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_OPEN_READ_TRIES

      This info is available at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. The value indicates the number of cache open
      read reattempts made by the transaction on cache open read failure.

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_OPEN_WRITE_TRIES

      This info is available at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. The value indicates the number of cache open
      write reattempts made by the transaction on cache open write failure.

   .. c:member:: TS_TXN_INFO_CACHE_VOLUME

      This info is available at or after :c:data:`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK` hook. The value indicates the cache volume ID used
      for the cache object associated with the transaction.

Return values

The API returns :c:data:`TS_SUCCESS`, if the requested info is supported, :c:data:`TS_ERROR` otherwise.
