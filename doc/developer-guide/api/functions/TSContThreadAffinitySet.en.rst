TSContThreadAffinitySet
***********************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSContThreadAffinitySet(TSCont contp, TSEventThread ethread)

Description
===========

Set the thread affinity of continuation :arg:`contp` to :arg:`ethread`. Future calls to
:func:`TSContScheduleOnPool`, and :func:`TSContScheduleOnPool` that has the same type as :arg:`ethread`
will schedule the continuation on :arg:`ethread`, rather than an arbitrary thread of that type.

:func:`TSContScheduleOnPool` and :func:`TSContScheduleEveryOnPool` will default the affinity to calling thread
when invoked without explicitly setting the thread affinity.

Return Values
=============

:data:`TS_SUCCESS` if thread affinity of continuation :arg:`contp` was set to :arg:`ethread`,
:data:`TS_ERROR` if not.
