Traffic Server API's related to Accept objects

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSAcceptor TSAcceptorGet(TSVConn sslp)
.. function:: TSAcceptor TSAcceptorGetbyID(int id)
.. function:: int TSAcceptorIDGet(TSAcceptor acceptor)
.. function:: int TSAcceptorCount()


Description
===========

Traffic Server allows plugins to get information from an accept object that created a certain TSVConn object using the above mentioned APIs.
An acceptor thread listens for incoming connections and creates the virtual connection (:type:`TSVConn`) for each accepted connection.

:func:`TSAcceptorGet` returns :type:`TSAcceptor` object that created :arg:`sslp`.

:func:`TSAcceptorGetbyID` returns the :type:`TSAcceptor` object identified by :arg:`id`. :type:`TSAcceptor` represents the acceptor object created by the core
traffic server.

:func:`TSAcceptorIDGet` returns the Integer number that identifies :arg:`acceptor`. All the cloned :type:`TSAcceptor` objects will have the same identifying number.

:func:`TSAcceptorCount` returns the number of :type:`TSAcceptor` objects created by the server.
