TSHttpTxnNextHopNameGet
***********************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: void TSHttpTxnNextHopStrategySet(TSHttpTxn txnp, void const* strategy)

Description
===========

Sets the next hop strategy for the transaction :arg:`txnp`
This :arg:`strategy` pointer must be a valid strategy and can be
nullptr to indicate that parent.config will be used instead.

Plugins can get a strategy by name by calling
:func:`TSHttpTxnNextHopStrategyGet` to get the current transaction's
active strategy or :func:`TSHttpTxnNextHopNamedStrategyGet` to
look up a strategy by name using the transaction's pointer to the
NextHopStrategyFactory strategy database.

.. note::

   This strategy pointer must not be freed and the contents must not
   be changed.
   Strategy pointers held by plugins will become invalid when ATS
   configs are reloaded and should be reset with :func:`TSRemapNewInstance`
