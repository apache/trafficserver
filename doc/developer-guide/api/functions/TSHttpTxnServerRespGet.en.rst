TSHttpTxnServerRespGet
**********************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnServerRespGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSMBuffer * bufp, TSMLoc * offset)

Description
===========

Get the response header sent by the upstream server. This will only be useful in a callback on a
hook that is called after the upstream responds, and if there was an upstream response. For
instance, if the inbound request has no remap rule and :ts:cv:`remap is required
<proxy.config.url_remap.remap_required>` then there will be no server response because no outbound
connection was made. In this case the function will return :c:macro:`TS_ERROR`.

The response header is returned in :arg:`bufp` and :arg:`offset`. :arg:`bufp` is the heap in which
the header resides, and :arg:`offset` is the location in that heap. These will be used in subsequent
calls to retrieve information from the header.

         return TSHttpHdrStatusGet(resp_headp, resp_hdr);
      }
      return HTTP_STATUS_NONE;
   }
