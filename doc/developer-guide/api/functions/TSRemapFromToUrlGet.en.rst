Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSRemapFromUrlGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSMLoc * urlLocp)
.. function:: TSReturnCode TSRemapToUrlGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSMLoc * urlLocp)

Description
===========

These functions are useful for transactions where the URL is remapped, due to matching a line in :file:`remap.config`.
:func:`TSRemapFromUrlGet` returns the *from* URL in the matching line in :file:`remap.config`.
:func:`TSRemapToUrlGet` returns the *to* URL in the matching line in :file:`remap.config`.
This info is available at or after the :c:data:`TS_HTTP_POST_REMAP_HOOK` hook.  If the function returns
:data:`TS_SUCCESS`, the location of the URL is put into the variable pointed to by :arg:`urlLocp`.  On error, the function
returns :data:`TS_ERROR`.
