TSMimeHdrFieldAppend
********************

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSMimeHdrFieldAppend(TSMBuffer bufp, TSMLoc hdr, TSMLoc field)

Description
===========

Attaches a MIME :arg:`field` to a header. The header is represented by the :arg:`bufp` and :arg:`hdr`
arguments which should have been obtained by a call to :func:`TSHttpTxnClientReqGet` or similar. If
the field in :arg:`field` was created by calling :func:`TSMimeHdrFieldCreateNamed` the same
:arg:`bufp` and :arg:`hdr` passed to that should be passed to this function.

Returns :code:`TS_SUCCESS` if the :arg:`field` was attached to the header, :code:`TS_ERROR` if it
was not. Fields cannot be attached to read only headers.
