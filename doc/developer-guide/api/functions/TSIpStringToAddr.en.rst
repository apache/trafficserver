TSIpStringToAddr
****************

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/experimental.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSIpStringToAddr(const char * str, int str_len, sockaddr* addr)

Description
===========

:arg:`str` is expected to be an explicit address, not a hostname.  No hostname resolution is done. This attempts to
recognize and process a port value if present. It is set appropriately, or to zero if no port was found or it was
malformed. 

It is intended to deal with the brackets that can optionally surround an IP address (usually IPv6) which in turn are
used to differentiate between an address and an attached port. E.g. 

.. code-block:: none

[FE80:9312::192:168:1:1]:80

Return values
=============

It returns :data:`TS_SUCCESS` on success, or :data:`TS_ERROR` on failure. 

Notes
=====

This API may be changed in the future version since it is experimental.
