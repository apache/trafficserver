TSVConnReenable
***************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: void TSVConnReenable(TSVConn svc)

Description
===========

Re-enable the SSL connection :arg:`svc`. If a plugin hook is called, ATS
processing on that connection will not resume until this is invoked for that
connection.

If the server is running OpenSSL 1.0.2, the plugin writer can pause SSL handshake
processing at the certificate callback  by not reenabling the connection.
Running an OpenSSL versions older than 1.0.2, the handshake processing in
``SSL_accept`` will not be stopped even if the SNI callback does not re-enable
the connection.

Additional processing could re-enable the virtual connection causing the
``SSL_accept`` to be called again to complete the handshake exchange.  In the
case of a blind tunnel conversion, the SSL handshake will never be completed by
Traffic Server.

This call does appropriate locking and scheduling, so it is safe to call from
another thread.

TSVConnReenableEx
*****************

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: void TSVConnReenableEx(TSVConn svc, TSEvent event)

Description
===========

An extended version of TSVConnEnable that allows the plugin to return a status to
the core logic.  If all goes well this is TS_EVENT_CONTINUE.  However, if
the plugin wants to stop the processing it can set the event to TS_EVENT_ERROR.

For example, in the case of the TS_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_HOOK, the plugin make decide the
origin certificate is bad.  By calling TSVonnReenable with TS_EVENT_ERROR, the
certificate check will error and the TLS handshake will fail.
