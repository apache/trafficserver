TSHttpTxnServerPacketTosSet
***************************

Change packet TOS for the server side connection.

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnServerPacketTosSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int tos)

Description
===========

.. note::

   The change takes effect immediately. If no OS connection has been
   made, then this sets the mark that will be used. If an OS connection
   is established

   TOS is deprecated and replaced by DSCP. This is still used to set
   DSCP, however the first 2 bits of this value will be ignored as they
   now belong to the ECN field.

.. XXX Third sentence in the first paragraph above needs to be completed.
