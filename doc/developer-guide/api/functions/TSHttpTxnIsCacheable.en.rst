TSHttpTxnIsCacheable
********************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnIsCacheable(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSMBuffer request, TSMBuffer response)

Description
===========

Determine if an upstream response is cacheable according to the current |TS| configuration and
state. All of the arguments must have be obtained via other API calls prior to calling this
function.

The :arg:`request` and :arg:`response` arguments must refer to HTTP header objects. These are
treated as the request and response for a transaction respectively. Based on the transaction state
from :arg:`txnp` and the contents of the request and response, this returns ``TS_SUCCESS`` if the
response is cacheable, ``TS_ERROR`` otherwise.
