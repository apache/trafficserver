TSHttpTxnResponseActionSet
**************************

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ts/ts.h>

.. function:: void TSHttpTxnResponseActionSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, TSResponseAction *action)

Description
===========

Takes a ResponseAction and sets it as the behavior for finding the
next parent.

Be aware ATS will never change this outside a plugin.
Therefore, plugins which set the ResponseAction to retry
must also un-set it after the subsequent success or failure,
or ATS will retry forever!

The passed *action* must not be null, and is copied and may be
destroyed after this call returns.

Callers must maintain owernship of action.hostname,
and its lifetime must exceed the transaction.
