Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: TSReturnCode TSMimeHdrClone(TSMBuffer dest_bufp, TSMBuffer src_bufp, TSMLoc src_hdr, TSMLoc * locp)

Description
===========

Copies a specified MIME header to a specified marshal buffer, and
returns the location of the copied MIME header within the destination
marshal buffer.

.. XXX The original paragraph above does not match the function prototype.

Unlike :c:func:`TSMimeHdrCopy`, you do not have to create the
destination MIME header before cloning.  Release the returned
:c:type:`TSMLoc` handle with a call to :c:func:`TSHandleMLocRelease`.
