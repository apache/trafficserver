TSfwrite
********

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: ssize_t TSfwrite(TSFile filep, const void * buf, size_t length)

Description
===========

Attempts to write :arg:`length` bytes of data from the buffer :arg:`buf` to the
file :arg:`filep`.

Make sure that :arg:`filep` is open for writing.  You might want to check the
number of bytes written (:c:func:`TSfwrite` returns this value) against the
value of :arg:`length`.  If it is less, there might be insufficient space on
disk, for example.

The behavior is undefined if length is greater than SSIZE_MAX.

Return Value
============

Returns the number of bytes actually written, or -1 if an error occured.
