TSHttpTxnIntercept
******************

Allows a plugin take over the servicing of the request as though it was the
origin server.

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: void TSHttpTxnIntercept(TSCont contp, TSHttpTxn txnp)

Description
===========

:arg:`contp` will be sent :macro:`TS_EVENT_NET_ACCEPT`. The edata passed
with :macro:`TS_EVENT_NET_ACCEPT` is an :c:type:`TSVConn` just as it
would be for a normal accept. The plugin must act as if it is an HTTP
server and read the HTTP request and body off the :c:type:`TSVConn`
and send an HTTP response header and body.

:func:`TSHttpTxnIntercept` must be called be called from only
:data:`TS_HTTP_READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK`.  Using
:type:`TSHttpTxnIntercept` will bypass the Traffic Server cache.  If
response sent by the plugin should be cached, use
:func:`TSHttpTxnServerIntercept` instead.
:func:`TSHttpTxnIntercept` primary use is allow plugins to serve
data about their functioning directly.

:func:`TSHttpTxnIntercept` must only be called once per transaction.
