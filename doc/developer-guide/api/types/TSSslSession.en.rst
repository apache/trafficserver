TSSslSession

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/apidefs.h>`

.. type:: TSSslSessionID

   .. member:: size_t len

   .. member:: char bytes[TS_SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH]

.. type:: TSSslSession

Description
===========

:type:`TSSslSessionID` represents the SSL session ID as a buffer and length.  The ``TS_SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH`` is the same value
as the openssl constant ``SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH``. The plugin has direct access to this object since creating and 
manipulating session IDs seems like a fairly common operation (rather than providing an API to access the data via an 
opaque TS object type).


:type:`TSSslSession` references the SSL session object.  It can be cast to the openssl type ``SSL_SESSION``.
