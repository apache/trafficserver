API Types
*********

This section documents all of the types defined by the |TS| C API. While each
type's documentation references the C header file in which they are defined,
``ts/apidefs.h``, please note that your plugins should never need to include
this file directly. Including the ``ts/ts.h`` header is sufficient.
