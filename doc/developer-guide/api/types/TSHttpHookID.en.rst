Description
===========

Note that :member:`TS_SSL_CERT_HOOK` and :member:`TS_SSL_SNI_HOOK` hook the same openssl callbacks.  
In openssl 1.0.2 and beyond :member:`TS_SSL_SERVERNAME_HOOK` is involved only for the openssl servername callback.  :member:`TS_SSL_SNI_HOOK` and :member:`TS_SSL_CERT_HOOK` are called for the openssl certificate callback.
