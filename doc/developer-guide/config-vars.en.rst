Configuration Variable Implementation
*************************************

Adding a new configuration variable in :file:`records.config` requires a number
of steps which are mostly documented here.

Before adding a new configuration variable, please discuss it on the mailing
list. It will commonly be the case that a better name, or a more general
approach to the problem which solves several different issues, may be suggested.

Defining the Variable
=====================

To begin, the new configuration variables must be added to |RecordsConfig.cc|_.
This contains a long array of configuration variable records. The fields for
each record are:

type:``RecT``
   Type of record. The valid values are:

   ``RECT_NULL``
      Undefined record.

   ``RECT_CONFIG``
      General configuration variable.

   ``RECT_PROCESS``
      Process related statistic.

   ``RECT_NODE``
      Local statistic.

   ``RECT_CLUSTER``
      Cluster statistic.

   ``RECT_LOCAL``
      Configuration variable that is explicitly not shared across a cluster.

   ``RECT_PLUGIN``
      Plugin created statistic.

   In general, ``RECT_CONFIG`` should be used unless it is required that the
   value not be shared among members of a cluster, in which case ``RECT_LOCAL``
   should be used. If you use ``RECT_LOCAL``, you must also start the line with
   ``LOCAL`` instead of ``CONFIG`` and the name should use ``.local.`` instead
   of ``.config.``.

name:``char const*``
   The fully qualified name of the configuration variable. Although there
   appears to be a hierarchial naming scheme, that's just a convention, and it
   is not actually used by the code. Nonetheless, new variables should adhere
   to the hierarchial scheme.

value_type:``RecDataT``
   The data type of the value. It should be one of ``RECD_INT``,
   ``RECD_STRING``, ``RECD_FLOAT`` as appropriate.

default:``char const*``
   The default value for the variable. This is always a string regardless of
   the *value_type*.

update:``RecUpdateT``
   Information about how the variable is updated. The valid values are:

   ``RECU_NULL``
      Behavior is unknown or unspecified.

.. _recu-dynamic:

   ``RECU_DYNAMIC``
      This can be updated via command line tools.

   ``RECD_RESTART_TS``
      The :program:`traffic_server` process must be restarted for a new value to take effect.

   ``RECD_RESTART_TM``
      The :program:`traffic_manager` process must be restarted for a new value to take effect.

required:``RecordRequiredType``
   Effectively a boolean that specifies if the record is required to be present,
   with ``RR_NULL`` meaning not required and ``RR_REQUIRED`` indicating that it
   is required. Given that using ``RR_REQUIRED`` would be a major
   incompatibility, ``RR_NULL`` is generally the better choice.

check:``RecCheckT``
   Additional type checking. It is unclear if this is actually implemented. The
   valid values are:

   ``RECC_NULL``
      No additional checking.

   ``RECC_STR``
      Verify the value is a string.

   ``RECC_INT``
      Verify the value is an integer.

   ``RECC_IP``
      Verify the value is an IP address. Unknown if this checks for IPv6.

.. XXX confirm RECC_IP & IPv6 behavior

pattern:``char const*``
   This provides a regular expressions (PCRE format) for validating the value,
   beyond the basic type validation performed by ``RecCheckT``. This can be
   ``NULL`` if there is no regular expression to use.

access:``RecAccessT``
   Access control. The valid values are:

   ``RECA_NULL``
      The value is read / write.

   ``RECA_READ_ONLY``
      The value is read only.

   ``RECA_NO_ACCESS``
      No access to the value; only privileged level parts of ATS can access the
      value.

Variable Infrastructure
=======================

The primary effort in defining a configuration variable is handling updates,
generally via :option:`traffic_ctl config reload`. This is handled in a generic way, as
described in the next section, or in a :ref:`more specialized way <http-config-var-impl>`
(built on top of the generic mechanism) for HTTP related configuration
variables. This is only needed if the variable is marked as dynamically
updateable (|RECU_DYNAMIC|_) although HTTP configuration variables should be
dynamic if possible.

Documentation and Defaults
--------------------------

A configuration variable should be documented in :file:`records.config`. There
are many examples in the file already that can be used for guidance. The general
format is to use the tag ::

   .. ts:cv:`variable.name.here`

The arguments to this are the same as for the configuration file. The
documentation generator will pick out key bits and use them to decorate the
entry. In particular if a value is present it will be removed and used as the
default value. You can attach some additional options to the variable. These
are:

reloadable
   The variable can be reloaded via command line on a running Traffic Server.

metric
   Specify the units for the value. This is critical for variables that use unexpected or non-obvious metrics, such as minutes instead of seconds, or disk sectors instead of bytes.

deprecated
   Mark a variable as deprecated.

.. topic:: Example

   \:ts\:cv\:\`custom.variable\`
      :reloadable:
      :units: minutes
      :deprecated:

If you need to refer to another configuration variable in the documentation, you
can use the form ::

   :ts:cv:`the.full.name.of.the.variable`

This will display the name as a link to the full definition.

In general, a new configuration variable should not be present in the default
:file:`records.config`. If it is added, such defaults should be added to the
file ``proxy/config/records.config.default.in``. This is used to generate the
default :file:`records.config`. Just add the variable to the file in an
appropriate place with a proper default as this will now override whatever
default you put in the code for new installs.

Handling Updates
----------------

The simplest mechanism for handling updates is the ``REC_EstablishStaticConfigXXX``
family of functions. This mechanism will cause the value in the indicated
instance to be updated in place when an update to :file:`records.config` occurs.
This is done asynchronously using atomic operations. Use of these variables must
keep that in mind.

If a variable requires additional handling when updated a callback can be
registered which is called when the variable is updated. This is what the
``REC_EstablishStaticConfigXXX`` calls do internally with a callback that simply
reads the new value and writes it to storage indicated by the call parameters.
The functions used are the ``link_XXX`` static functions in |RecCore.cc|_.

To register a configuration variable callback, call ``RecRegisterConfigUpdateCb``
with the arguments:

``char const*`` *name*
   The variable name.

*callback*
   A function with the signature ``<int (char const* name, RecDataT type, RecData data, void* cookie)>``.
   The :arg:`name` value passed is the same as the :arg:`name` passed to the
   registration function as is the :arg:`cookie` argument. The :arg:`type` and
   :arg:`data` are the new value for the variable. The return value is currently
   ignored. For future compatibility return ``REC_ERR_OKAY``.

``void*`` *cookie*
   A value passed to the *callback*. This is only for the callback, the
   internals simply store it and pass it on.

*callback* is called under lock so it should be quick and not block. If that is
necessary a :term:`continuation` should be scheduled to handle the required
action.

.. note::

   The callback occurs asynchronously. For HTTP variables as described in the
   next section, this is handled by the more specialized HTTP update mechanisms.
   Otherwise it is the implementor's responsibility to avoid race conditions.

.. _http-config-var-impl:

HTTP Configuation Values
------------------------

Variables used for HTTP processing should be declared as members of the
``HTTPConfigParams`` structure (but see :ref:`overridable-config-vars` for
further details) and use the specialized HTTP update mechanisms which handle
synchronization and initialization issues.

The configuration logic maintains two copies of the ``HTTPConfigParams``
structure, the master copy and the current copy. The master copy is kept in the
``m_master`` member of the ``HttpConfig`` singleton. The current copy is kept in
the ConfigProcessor. The goal is to provide a (somewhat) atomic update for
configuration variables which are loaded individually in to the master copy as
updates are received and then bulk copied to a new instance which is then
swapped in as the current copy. The HTTP state machine interacts with this
mechanism to avoid race conditions.

For each variable, a mapping between the variable name and the appropriate
member in the master copy should be established between in the ``HTTPConfig::startup``
method. The ``HttpEstablishStaticConfigXXX`` functions should be used unless
there is a strong, explicit reason to not do so.

The ``HTTPConfig::reconfigure`` method handles the current copy of the HTTP
configuration variables. Logic should be added here to copy the value from the
master copy to the current copy. Generally this will be a simple assignment. If
there are dependencies between variables, those should be checked and enforced
in this method.

.. _overridable-config-vars:

Overridable Variables
---------------------

HTTP related variables that are changeable per transaction are stored in the
``OverridableHttpConfigParams`` structure, an instance of which is the ``oride``
member of ``HTTPConfigParams`` and therefore the points in the previous section
still apply. The only difference for that is the further ``.oride`` member specifier in the structure references.

The variable is required to be accessible from the transaction API. In addition
to any custom API functions used to access the value, the following items are
required for generic access:

#. Add a value to the ``TSOverridableConfigKey`` enumeration in |apidefs.h.in|_.

#. Augment the ``TSHttpTxnConfigFind`` function to return this enumeration value
   when given the name of the configuration variable. Be sure to count the
   charaters very carefully.

#. Augment the ``_conf_to_memberp`` function in |InkAPI.cc|_ to return a pointer
   to the appropriate member of ``OverridableHttpConfigParams`` and set the type
   if not a byte value.

#. Update the testing logic in |InkAPITest.cc|_ by adding the string name of the
   configuration variable to the ``SDK_Overridable_Configs`` array.

#. Update the Lua plugin enumeration ``TSLuaOverridableConfigKey`` in |ts_lua_http_config.c|_.

#. Update the documentation of :ref:`ts-overridable-config` in |TSHttpOverridableConfig.en.rst|_.
