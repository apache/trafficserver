Core Cache
**********

Core Cache Constants
====================

.. c:macro:: EVACUATION_SIZE

   The size of the contiguous area to check for evacuation.

Core Cache Types
================

.. cpp:class:: CacheKey

  The hash value for a cache object. Currently a 128 bit MD5 hash.
  
.. cpp:class:: EvacuationBlock

   A range of content to be evacuated.

.. cpp:class:: CacheProcessor

   The singleton cache management object. This handles threads and global initialization for the cache.
   
   .. cpp:member:: int start(int n_threads, size_t stacksize)
   
      Starts the cache processing threads, :arg:`n_threads` are created each with a stack of size :arg:`stacksize`.

.. cpp:class:: Span

   A representation of a unit of cache storage, a single physical device, file, or directory.

.. cpp:class:: Store

   A representation of a collection of cache storage.
   
   .. cpp:member:: Span ** disk
   
      List of :cpp:class:`Span` instances that describe the physical storage.

.. cpp:class:: CacheDisk

   A representation of the physical device used for a :cpp:class:`Span`.
  
.. cpp:class:: CacheHostRecord

   A record from :file:`hosting.config`.

Core Cache Functions
====================

.. cpp:function:: int dir_probe(const CacheKey * key, Vol * d, Dir * result, Dir ** last_collision)

  Probe the stripe directory for a candidate directory entry.
  
.. cpp:function:: void build_vol_hash_table(CacheHostRecord * r)

   Based on the configuration record :arg:`r`, construct the global stripe assignment table.
   
.. cpp:function:: int cplist_reconfigure()

   Rebuild the assignment of stripes to volumes.
   
.. cpp:function:: void ink_cache_init(ModuleVersion v)

   Top level cache initialization logic.
