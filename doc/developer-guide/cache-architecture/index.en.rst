Cache Architecture
******************

The original architectural documents for Traffic Server were lost in the
transition to an open source project. The documents in this section are
provisional and were written based on the existing code. The purpose is to have
a high level description of aspects of Traffic Server to better inform ongoing
work.

In the final section on "hacking" we try to document our approaches to
understanding and modifying the source.
