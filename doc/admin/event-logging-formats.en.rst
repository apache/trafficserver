    hex.

    See `cquuc`_.

.. _cqup:

``cqup``
    The client request URL path; specifies the argument portion of the

    See `cquup`_.

.. _cqus:

    was served out of. This is useful for example to show whether it was a
    RAM cache vs disk cache hit. Future versions of the cache will support
    more levels, but right now it only supports RAM (``HIT_RAM``) vs
    rotational disk (``HIT_DISK``).

.. _csscl:

``phn``
    The hostname of the Traffic Server that generated the log entry in
    collated log files.

.. _phi:

``phi``

``pqsn``
    The proxy request server name; the name of the server that fulfilled
    the request.

.. _pscl:

``pscl``
    The length of the Traffic Server response to the client (in bytes).

.. _psct:

``psct``
    The content type of the document from server response header: (for
    example, ``img/gif`` ).

.. _pshl:

    The IP address resolved from the DNS name lookup of the host in the
    request. For hosts with multiple IP addresses, this field records
    the IP address resolved from that particular DNS lookup.

    This can be misleading for cached documents. For example: if the
    first request was a cache miss and came from *IP1* for server
    *S* and the second request for server *S* resolved to
    *IP2* but came from the cache, then the log entry for the
    second request will show *IP2*.

    The time spent accessing the origin (in milliseconds); the time is
    measured from the time the connection with the origin is established
    to the time the connection is closed.

.. _stmsh:

``stmsh``
    Same as ``stms`` but in hexadecimal.

.. _stmsf:

``stmsf``
    The time Traffic Server spends accessing the origin as a fractional
    number of seconds. That is, the time is formated as a floating-point
    number, instead of an integer as in ``stms``.

    For example: if the time is 1500 milliseconds, then this field
    displays 1.5 while the ``stms`` field displays 1500 and the ``sts``
    field displays 1.

.. _sts:

``sts``
    The time Traffic Server spends accessing the origin, in seconds.

.. _ttms:

``ttms``
    The time Traffic Server spends processing the client request; the
    number of milliseconds between the time the client establishes the
    connection with Traffic Server and the time Traffic Server sends the
    last byte of the response back to the client.

.. _ttmsh:

``ttmsh``
    Same as ``ttms`` but in hexadecimal.

.. _ttmsf:

``ttmsf``
    The time Traffic Server spends processing the client request as a
    fractional number of seconds. Time is specified in millisecond
    resolution; however, instead of formatting the output as an integer
    (as with ``ttms``), the display is formatted as a floating-point
    number representing a fractional number of seconds.

    For example: if the time is 1500 milliseconds, then this field
    displays 1.5 while the ``ttms`` field displays 1500 and the ``tts``
    field displays 1.

.. _tts:

``tts``
    The time Traffic Server spends processing the client request; the
    number of seconds between the time at which the client establishes
    the connection with Traffic Server and the time at which Traffic
    Server sends the last byte of the response back to the client.

.. _log-field-slicing:

Log Field Slicing
=================

It is sometimes desirable to slice a log field to limit the length of a given
log field's output.

Log Field slicing can be specified as below:

``%<field[start:end]>``
``%<{field}container[start:end]>``

Omitting the slice notation defaults to the entire log field.

Slice notation only applies to a log field that is of type string
and can not be applied to ip/timestamp which are converted to
string from integer.

The below slice specifiers are allowed.

``[start:end]``
          Log field value from start through end-1
``[start:]``
          Log field value from start through the rest of the string
``[:end]``
          Log field value from the beginning through end-1
``[:]``
          Default - entire Log field

Some examples below ::

  '%<cqup>'       //the whole characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup>[:]'    //the whole characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[0:30]>' //the first 30 characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[-10:]>' //the last 10 characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[:-5]>'  //everything except the last 5 characters of <cqup>.
