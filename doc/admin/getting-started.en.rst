Before You Start
================

Before you get started with Traffic Server you may have to decide which
version you want to use. Traffic Server follows the `Semantic Versioning
<http://semver.org>`_ guidelines.

A complete version number is made of a version-triplet: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.

As of v4.0.0, there are no longer any development (or unstable) releases.
All releases are considered stable and ready for production use. Releases
within a major version are always upgrade compatible. More details are
available on the `New Release Processes
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Release+Process>`_ wiki
page.

Sometimes we speak of *trunk*, *master* or *HEAD*, all of which are used
interchangeably. Trunk and master, or sometimes TIP or HEAD, refer to the
latest code in a Git version control system (also referred to as a *repository*
or *Git repo*). Master is always kept releasable, and compatible with the
current major release version. Incompatible changes are sometimes committed on
a next-major release branch; for example, we have the ``5.0.x`` branch where
changes incompatible with 4.x are managed.

If your distribution does not come with a prepackaged Traffic Server,
please go to `downloads <https://trafficserver.apache.org/downloads>`_ to choose the version that you
consider most appropriate for yourself. If you want to really be on the
bleeding edge you can clone our `git
repository <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/trafficserver.git>`_.

.. note::

    We do also have a `GitHub Mirror <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver>`_
    that you may use to submit pull requests. However, it may not be
    entirely up-to-date, and you should always refer to our official project
    Git repository for the very latest state of the source code.

Building Traffic Server
=======================

In order to build Traffic Server from source you will need the following
development tools and libraries installed:

-  pkgconfig
-  libtool
-  gcc (>= 4.3 or clang > 3.0)
-  GNU make
-  openssl
-  tcl
-  expat
-  pcre
-  libcap
-  flex (for TPROXY)
-  hwloc
-  lua
-  curses (for :program:`traffic_top`)
-  curl (for :program:`traffic_top`)

If you're building from a git clone, you'll also need:

-  git
-  autoconf
-  automake

The following instructions demonstrate building a fresh Traffic Server from
Git sources.

#. Clone the official Git repository for Traffic Server. ::

    git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/trafficserver.git

#. Change your work directory to the newly-cloned local repository and run autoreconf. ::

    cd trafficserver/
    autoreconf -if

#. A ``configure`` script will be generated from ``configure.ac`` which may now
   be used to configure the source tree for your build. ::

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/ats

   By default, Traffic Server will be built to use the ``nobody`` user and group.
   You may change this with the ``--with-user`` argument to ``configure``::

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/ats --with-user=tserver

   If dependencies are not in standard paths (``/usr/local`` or ``/usr``),
   you may need to pass options to ``configure`` to account for that::

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/ats --with-lua=/opt/csw

   Most ``configure`` path-options accept a format of "*INCLUDE_PATH*:*LIBRARY_PATH*"::

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/ats --with-pcre=/opt/csw/include:/opt/csw/lib/amd64

#. Once the source tree has been configured, you may proceed on to building with
   the generated Makefiles. The ``make check`` command may be used to perform
   sanity checks on the resulting build, prior to installation, and it is
   recommended that you use this. ::

    make
    make check

#. With the source built and checked, you may now install all of the binaries,
   header files, documentation, and other artifacts to their final locations on
   your system. ::

    sudo make install

#. Finally, it is recommended that you run the regression test suite. Please note
   that the regression tests will only be successful with the default layout. ::

    cd /opt/ats
    sudo bin/traffic_server -R 1

.. _build-traffic-server-with-spdy:

Building Traffic Server with SPDY
=================================

Traffic Server v5.0.x and above support SPDY. The following instructions demonstrate
building a fresh Traffic Server with SPDY enabled from Git sources.

#. Clone the spdylay Git repository from tatsuhiro. ::

    git clone https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/spdylay

#. The below steps will build spdylay library and set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH ::

    cd spdylay/
    autoreconf -if
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/spdylay
    make install
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/spdylay/lib/pkgconfig/

#. Finally, you can build trafficserver following the steps in the previous section along
   with an additional option --enable-spdy as below  ::

    ./configure --enable-spdy

You are now ready to configure and run your Traffic Server installation.

.. _start-traffic-server:

Start Traffic Server
====================

To start Traffic Server manually, issue the ``trafficserver`` command,
passing in the subcommand ``start``. This command starts all the
processes that work together to process Traffic Server requests as well
as manage, control, and monitor the health of the Traffic Server system. ::

   bin/trafficserver start

.. _start-straffic-line:

Start Traffic Line
==================

Traffic Line provides a quick way of viewing Traffic Server statistics
and configuring the Traffic Server system via a command-line interface. To
execute individual commands or script multiple commands, refer to
:program:`traffic_line`.

Traffic Line commands take the following form::

     bin/traffic_line -command argument

For a list of :program:`traffic_line` commands, enter::

     bin/traffic_line -h

Please note that :program:`traffic_line`, while a fine tool for an
administrator, is a poor choice for automation, especially that of
monitoring. See our chapter on :ref:`monitoring-traffic`
for how to do that more efficiently and effectively.

.. _stop-traffic-server:

Stop Traffic Server
===================

To stop Traffic Server, always use the :program:`trafficserver` command,
passing in the attribute ``stop``. This command stops all the Traffic
Server processes (:program:`traffic_manager`, :program:`traffic_server`, and
:program:`traffic_cop`). Do not manually stop processes, as this can lead to
unpredictable results. ::

    bin/trafficserver stop
