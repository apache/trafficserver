Traffic Server provides several options for monitoring system
performance and analyzing network traffic.

Traffic Server Monitoring Tools
===============================

Traffic Server provides the following tools to monitor system
performance and analyze network traffic:

-  Traffic Server can send email that's triggered by alarms that signal
   any detected failure conditions; refer to `Working with Traffic Manager Alarms`_.

-  The Traffic Line command-line interface provides an alternative
   method of viewing Traffic Server performance and network traffic
   information; refer to `Viewing Statistics from Traffic Line`_.


Working with Traffic Manager Alarms
===================================

Traffic Server signals an alarm when it detects a problem. For example,
the space allocated to event logs could be full or Traffic Server may
not be able to write to a configuration file.

Configuring Traffic Server to Email Alarms
------------------------------------------

To configure Traffic Server to send an email to a specific address
whenever an alarm occurs, follow the steps below:

#. Set :ts:cv:`proxy.config.alarm_email` in :file:`records.config` to the email
   address you want to receive alarm notifications. ::

        CONFIG proxy.config.alarm_email STRING "alerts@example.com"

#. Run the command :option:`traffic_ctl config reload` to apply the configuration changes.

Using a Script File for Alarms
------------------------------

Alarm messages are built into Traffic Server and cannot be changed.
However, you can write a script file to execute certain actions when an
alarm is signaled. Traffic Server provides a sample script file named
``example_alarm_bin.sh`` in the ``bin`` directory which can serve as the
basis for your custom alarm scripts.

Viewing Statistics from Traffic Line
====================================

You can use the Traffic Line command-line interface to view statistics
about Traffic Server performance and web traffic. In addition to viewing
statistics, you can also configure, stop, and restart the Traffic Server
system. For additional information, refer to :ref:`configure-using-traffic-line`
and :ref:`traffic-line-commands`. You can view
specific information about a Traffic Server node or cluster by
specifying the variable that corresponds to the statistic you want to
see.

To view a statistic, enter the following command:::

        traffic_ctl metric get VARIABLE

where ``variable`` is the variable representing the information you
want to view. For a list of variables you can specify, refer to :ref:`Traffic
Server Metrics <traffic-line-performance-statistics>`.

For example, the following command displays the document hit rate for
the Traffic Server node:::

     traffic_ctl metric get proxy.node.cache_hit_ratio

If the Traffic Server ``bin`` directory is not in your path, then
prepend the Traffic Line command with ``./`` (for example:
:option:`traffic_ctl metric get` ``VARIABLE``).


Viewing Statistics with Traffic Top
===================================

The Traffic Top program (see :program:`traffic_top`) offers a *top-like* view of
common statistics for your Traffic Server system. You must be running
:ref:`plugin-stats-over-httpd` for Traffic Top to function.

.. XXX: We're missing docs on how to use traffic_top here.
