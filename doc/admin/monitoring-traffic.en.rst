Traffic Server provides several options for monitoring system
performance and analyzing network traffic.

Traffic Server Monitoring Tools
===============================

Traffic Server provides the following tools to monitor system
performance and analyze network traffic:

-  Traffic Server can send email that's triggered by alarms that signal
   any detected failure conditions; refer to `Working with Traffic Manager Alarms`_.
-  The Traffic Line command-line interface provides an alternative
   method of viewing Traffic Server performance and network traffic
   information; refer to `Viewing Statistics from Traffic Line`_.
-  The Traffic Shell command-line tool provides yet another alternative
   method of viewing Traffic Server performance and network traffic
   information; refer to `Starting Traffic Shell <../getting-started#StartTrafficShell>`_.


Working with Traffic Manager Alarms
===================================

Traffic Server signals an alarm when it detects a problem. For example,
the space allocated to event logs could be full or Traffic Server may
not be able to write to a configuration file.

Configuring Traffic Server to Email Alarms
------------------------------------------

To configure Traffic Server to send an email to a specific address
whenever an alarm occurs, follow the steps below:

1. In the :file:`records.config` file
2. Set the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.alarm_email` variable to the email address alarms will be routed to.
3. Run the command :option:`traffic_line -x` to apply the configuration
   changes.

Using a Script File for Alarms
------------------------------

Alarm messages are built into Traffic Server - you cannot change them.
However, you can write a script file to execute certain actions when an
alarm is signaled. Traffic Server provides a sample script file named
``example_alarm_bin.sh`` in the ``bin`` directory; simply modify the
file to suit your needs.

Viewing Statistics from Traffic Line
====================================

You can use the Traffic Line command-line interface to view statistics
about Traffic Server performance and web traffic. In addition to viewing
statistics, you can also configure, stop, and restart the Traffic Server
system. For additional information, refer to :ref:`configure-using-traffic-line`
and :ref:`traffic-line-commands`. You can view
specific information about a Traffic Server node or cluster by
specifying the variable that corresponds to the statistic you want to
see.

**To view a statistic**, enter the following command:::

        traffic_line -r variable

where ``variable`` is the variable representing the information you
want to view. For a list of variables you can specify, refer to :ref:`Traffic
Line Variables <traffic-line-performance-statistics>`.

For example, the following command displays the document hit rate for
the Traffic Server node:::

     traffic_line -r proxy.node.cache_hit_ratio

If the Traffic Server ``bin`` directory is not in your path, then
prepend the Traffic Line command with ``./`` (for example:
:option:`traffic_line -r` ``variable``).
