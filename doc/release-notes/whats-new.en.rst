New Features
------------

This version of ATS has a number of new features (details below), but we're particularly excited about the following features:

* Experimental QUIC support (draft 27 and 29).
* TLS v1.3 0RTT support.

PROXY protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ATS now supports the `PROXY <https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt>`_ protocol, on the inbound side. The
incoming PROXY data gets transformed into the ``Forwarded`` header.

Developer features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add support for dtrace style markers (SDT) and include a few markers at locations of interest to users of SystemTap, dtrace, and
  gdb. See :ref:`developer-debug-builds`.

Command line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The :program:`traffic_server` program now has two new maintenance commands: ``verify_global_plugin`` and ``verify_remap_plugin``.
  These commands load a plugin's shared object file and verify it meets minimal global or remap plugin API requirements.

Incompatible records.config settings
------------------------------------

These are the changes that are most likely to cause problems during an upgrade.
Take special care making sure you have updated your configurations accordingly.

Connection management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old settings for origin connection management included the following settings:

* `proxy.config.http.origin_max_connections`
* `proxy.config.http.origin_max_connections_queue`
* `proxy.config.http.origin_min_keep_alive_connections`

These are all gone, and replaced with the following set of configurations:

* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.max` (overridable)
* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.match` (overridable)
* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.alert_delay`
* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_size`
* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_delay`
* :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.min`

Logging and Metrics
-------------------

Plugins
-------

xdebug
~~~~~~

* A new directive, `fwd=<n>` to control the number of hops the header is forwarded for.

Plugin APIs
-----------

The API for server push is promoted to stable, and modified to return an error code, to be consistent with other similar APIs. The
new prototype is:

.. code-block:: c

    .. c:function:: TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnServerPush(TSHttpTxn txnp, const char *url, int url_len);
