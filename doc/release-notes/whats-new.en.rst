   :maxdepth: 1

New Features
------------

* JSON-RPC based interface for administrative API

   |TS| now exposes a JSON-RPC node to interact with external tools. Check :ref:`developer-guide-jsonrpc` for more details.

* :file:`ip_allow.yaml` and :file:`remap.config` now support named IP ranges via IP
  Categories. See the ``ip_categories`` key definition in :file:`ip_allow.yaml`
  for information about their use and definitions.


New or modified Configurations
------------------------------

Combined Connect Timeouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration settings :ts:cv: `proxy.config.http.parent_proxy.connect_attempts_timeout` and :ts:cv: `proxy.config.http.post_connect_attempts_timeout` have been removed.
All connect timeouts are controlled by :ts:cv: `proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_timeout`.


ip_allow.yaml and remap.config ACL actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two new sets of actions for HTTP request method filtering introduced in |TS| 10.x:

- Both :file:`ip_allow.yaml` and :file:`remap.config` now support the ``set_allow`` and ``set_deny`` actions. These
  actions both behave like ``allow`` and ``deny`` did for :file:`ip_allow.yaml` pre |TS| 10.x.
- In addition, :file:`remap.config` now supports ``add_allow`` and ``add_deny`` actions. These behave like ``allow``
  and ``deny`` actions did for :file:`remap.config` ACLs pre |TS| 10.x.

The details about the motivation and behavior of these actions are documented in :ref:`acl-filters`.


Logging and Metrics
-------------------

Plugins
-------

* JSON-RPC

   Remote clients, like :ref:`traffic_ctl_jsonrpc` have now bi-directional access to the plugin space. For more details check :ref:`jsonrpc_development`.

Switch to C++20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plugins are now required to be compiled as C++ code, rather than straight C.
The API is tested with C++20, so code compatible with this version is preferred.
``TSDebug`` and related functions are removed.  Debug tracing should now be done
using cpp:func:`Dbg` and related functions, as in |TS| core code.

C++ Plugin API Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is deprecated in this release.  It will be deleted in ATS 11.

Symbols With INKUDP Prefix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the plugin API, all types and functions starting with the prefix INKUDP are removed.

New plugin hook for request sink transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new hook, ``TS_HTTP_REQUEST_CLIENT_HOOK``, has been added. This provides the analoguas functionality of
``TS_HTTP_RESPONSE_CLIENT_HOOK``, for request bodies.
