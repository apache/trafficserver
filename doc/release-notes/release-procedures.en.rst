ATS Release Procedure Steps
===========================

   - Make sure all commits are in the branch being worked on
   - Update the configure.ac and trafficserver.spec version numbers
   - Run `make changelog` to generate a new changelog file for the new version (this is based on GitHub Milestone tags, so make sure PRs/Commits are properly tagged with the new version)
   - Commit the new changelog, configure.ac and trafficserver.spec files
   - Run `make rel-candidate`, this will generate the tar files and create a RC git tag
   - Push the new tag, `git push origin <tag_name>`
   - Upload the tar files to your own people.apache.org for hosting
   - Have someone double check the build, sha, etc.
   - Call for a vote on the RC

   - After the vote has passed update the tar files to remove the RC and update the sha value
   - Publish to apache releases

   ::

      svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/trafficserver/
      cd trafficserver
      mv ../trafficserver-${version}.tar* .
      svn add trafficserver-${version}.tar*
      svn commit . -m "Release $version"
      cd ..
      rm -rf trafficserver

   - Publish the updated version information to the TrafficServer website
