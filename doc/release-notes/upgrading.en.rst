Cache
-----
The cache in this releases of ATS is compatible with previous versions of ATS. You would not expect
to lose your cache, or have to reinitialize the cache when upgrading.

Configuration Changes
---------------------
The following incompatible changes to the configurations have been made in this version of ATS.

The ``records.config`` file has been renamed to :file:`records.yaml` and now it is structured in YAML format.

The following :file:`records.yaml` changes have been made:

- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.down_server.abort_threshold`` has been removed.
- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_max_retries_dead_server`` has been renamed to ``proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_max_retries_down_server``.
- The entry ``proxy.config.http.connect.dead.policy`` has been renamed to ``proxy.config.http.connect.down.policy``.
- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.parent_proxy.connect_attempts_timeout`` and
  ``proxy.config.http.post_connect_attempts_timeout`` have been removed. Instead use
  ``proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_timeout`` to control all connection to origin timeouts.
- The per server origin connection feature had a few configurations that were not used removed.
  ``proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_size`` and ``proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_delay``
  have been removed.
- The records.yaml entries ``proxy.config.http.parent_proxy.connect_attempts_timeout`` and
  ``proxy.config.http.post_connect_attempts_timeout`` were previously referenced in default config
  files, but they did not have any effect.  These have been removed from default configs files.
- The default values for ``proxy.config.http.request_header_max_size``, ``proxy.config.http.response_header_max_size``, and
  ``proxy.config.http.header_field_max_size`` have been changed to 32KB.

The following changes have been made to the :file:`sni.yaml` file:

- ``disable_h2`` has been removed. Use ``http2`` with :code:`off` instead.
