Upgrading to ATS v10.x
======================

.. toctree::

Feature Changes
---------------

Removed and Deprecated Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following features, configurations and plugins are either removed or deprecated in this
version of ATS. Deprecated features should be avoided, with the expectation that they will be
removed in the next major release of ATS.

* Removed Features
  * HostDB no longer supports persistent storage for DNS resolution
  * Removed support for the MMH crypto hash function

  * Traffic Manager is no longer part of |TS|. Administrative tools now interact with |TS| directly by using the :ref:`jsonrpc-node`.

    * traffic_ctl ``server``

      As a part of the above feature removal the ``backtrace``, ``restart``, ``start``, ``status`` options are no longer available in this |TS| version.

* Deprecated Features

  * Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) support has been deprecated from ATS and will be removed in the next major release.

Changes to Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following features have been changed in this version of ATS.

   Fixes with @action=allow to deny transactions that are not explicitly allowed.  Changed in-line ACLs to match before activated ACL rules.
   For detail refer to: https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/pull/11033



* Administrative API (RPC)

  Moved away from the binary serialization mechanism used to comunicate between |TS| and the tools to a JSON-RPC text based protocol. Underlying

Cache
-----
The cache in this releases of ATS is compatible with previous versions of ATS. You would not expect
to lose your cache, or have to reinitialize the cache when upgrading.

Configuration Changes
---------------------
The following incompatible changes to the configurations have been made in this version of ATS.

The ``records.config`` file has been renamed to :file:`records.yaml` and now it is structured in YAML format.

The following :file:`records.yaml` changes have been made:

- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.down_server.abort_threshold`` has been removed.
- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_max_retries_dead_server`` has been renamed to :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_max_retries_down_server`.
- The entry ``proxy.config.http.connect.dead.policy`` has been renamed to :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.connect.down.policy`.
- The records.yaml entry ``proxy.config.http.parent_proxy.connect_attempts_timeout`` and
  ``proxy.config.http.post_connect_attempts_timeout`` have been removed. Instead use
  :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.connect_attempts_timeout` to control all connection to origin timeouts.
- The per server origin connection feature had a few configurations that were not used removed.
  ``proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_size`` and ``proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.queue_delay``
  have been removed.
- The records.yaml entries ``proxy.config.http.parent_proxy.connect_attempts_timeout`` and
  ``proxy.config.http.post_connect_attempts_timeout`` were previously referenced in default config
  files, but they did not have any effect.  These have been removed from default configs files.
- The default values for :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.request_header_max_size`, :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.response_header_max_size`, and
  :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.header_field_max_size` have been changed to 32KB.
- The records.yaml entry :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.server_ports` now also accepts the
  ``allow-plain`` option
- The records.yaml entry :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.cache.max_open_write_retry_timeout` has been added to specify a timeout for starting a write to cache
- The records.yaml entry :ts:cv:`proxy.config.net.per_client.max_connections_in` has
  been added to limit the number of connections from a client IP. This works the
  same as :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.per_server.connection.max`
- The records.yaml entry :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.no_dns_just_forward_to_parent` is
  not overridable

The following changes have been made to the :file:`sni.yaml` file:

- ``disable_h2`` has been removed. Use ``http2`` with :code:`off` instead.
- The ``ip_allow`` key can now take a reference to a file containing the ip
  allow rules
