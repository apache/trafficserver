What is Apache Traffic Server?
==============================

|ATS| is a high-performance web proxy cache that improves network efficiency
and performance by caching frequently-accessed information at the edge of the
network. This brings content physically closer to end users, while enabling
faster delivery and reduced bandwidth use. |TS| is designed to improve content
delivery for enterprises, Internet service providers (ISPs), backbone
providers, and large intranets by maximizing existing and available bandwidth.

This manual will explore every aspect of installing, managing, extending, and
troubleshooting |TS|.

Typographic Conventions
=======================

This documentation uses the following typographic conventions:

Italic
    Used to introduce new terms on their initial appearance.

    Example:
        The |ATS| object storage is based on a *cyclone buffer* architecture.
        Cyclone buffers are a form of storage addressing in which a single
        writer continually reclaims the oldest allocations for use by new
        updates.

Monospace
    Represents C/C++ language statements, commands, file paths, file content,
    and computer output.

    Example:
        The default installation prefix for |TS| is ``/usr/local/ts``.

Bracketed Monospace
    Represents variables for which you should substitute a value in file content
    or commands.

    Example:
        Running the command ``traffic_ctl metric get <name>`` will display the current
        value of a performance statistic, where ``<name>`` is the statistic
        whose value you wish to view.

Ellipsis
    Indicates the omission of irrelevant or unimportant information.
