"The |TS| Software Developer's Kit is a reference for creating plugins. "
"*Plugins* are programs that add services (such as filtering or content "
"transformation) or entire features (such as new protocol support) to |TS|. "
"If you are new to writing |TS| plugins, then read the first two chapters, :"
"ref:`developer-plugins-getting-started` and :ref:`developer-plugins-"
"introduction`, and use the remaining chapters as needed. :ref:`developer-"
"plugins-header-based-examples` provides details about plugins that work on "
"HTTP headers, while :ref:`developer-plugins-http-transformations` explains "
"how to write a plugin that transforms or scans the body of an HTTP "
"response. If you want to support your own protocol on Traffic Server, then "
"reference :ref:`developer-plugins-new-protocol-plugins`."
