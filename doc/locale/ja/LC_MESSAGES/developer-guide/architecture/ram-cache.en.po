"The *Cached List* contains objects actually in memory. The basic operation "

"see if the object is in the Cached List or History. Hits result in updating "
"the ``hit`` field and reinsertion of the object. History hits result in the "
"``hit`` field being updated and a comparison to see if this object should "
"be kept in memory. The comparison is against the least recently used "

"The *Seen List* becomes active after the *Cached* and *History* lists "
"become full following a cold start. The purpose is to make the cache scan "
"resistant, which means that the cache state must not be affected at all by "
"a long sequence Get and Put operations on objects which are seen only once. "
"This is essential, and without it not only would the cache be polluted, but "
"it could lose critical information about the objects that it cares about. "
"It is therefore essential that the Cache and History lists are not affected "
"by Get or Put operations on objects seen the first time. The Seen Hash "
"maintains a set of 16 bit hash tags, and requests which do not hit in the "
"object cache (are in the Cache List or History List) and do not match the "
"hash tag result in the hash tag being updated but are otherwise ignored. "
"The Seen Hash is sized to approximately the number of objects in the cache "
"in order to match the number that are passed through it with the CLOCK rate "
"of the Cached and History Lists."
