"The :type:`TSIOBuffer` data structure is the building block of the :type:"
"`TSVConn` abstraction. An IO buffer is composed of a list of buffer blocks "
"which are reference counted so that they can reside in multiple buffers at "
"the same time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one IO "
"buffer to another using :func:`TSIOBufferCopy` since Traffic Server only "
"needs to copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately and not "
"actually copy any data. However, applications should still strive to ensure "
"data blocks are a reasonable size."

"The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple "
"readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each other, they "
"manipulate IO buffers through the :type:`TSIOBufferReader` data structure. "
"Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no corresponding :type:"
"`TSIOBufferWriter` data structure. The writer simply modifies the IO buffer "
"directly."

":func:`TSIOBufferDestroy` destroys the IO buffer :arg:`bufp`. Since "
"multiple IO buffers can share data, this does not necessarily free all of "
"the data associated with the IO buffer but simply decrements the "
"appropriate reference counts."

":func:`TSIOBufferProduce` makes :arg:`nbytes` of data available for reading "

"The watermark of an :type:`TSIOBuffer` is the minimum number of bytes of "
"data that have to be in the buffer before calling back any continuation "
"that has initiated a read operation on this buffer. As a writer feeds data "
"into the :type:`TSIOBuffer`, no readers are called back until the amount of "
"data reaches the watermark. Setting a watermark can improve performance "
"because it avoids frequent callbacks to read small amounts of data. :func:"
