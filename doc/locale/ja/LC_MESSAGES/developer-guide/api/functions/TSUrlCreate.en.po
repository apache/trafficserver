":func:`TSUrlParse` parses a URL. The :arg:`start` pointer is both an input "
"and an output parameter and marks the start of the URL to be parsed. After "
"a successful parse, the :arg:`start` pointer equals the :arg:`end` pointer. "
"The :arg:`end` pointer must be one byte after the last character you want "
"to parse. The URL parsing routine assumes that everything between :arg:"
"`start` and :arg:`end` is part of the URL. It is up to higher level parsing "
"routines, such as :func:`TSHttpHdrParseReq`, to determine the actual end of "
"the URL."
