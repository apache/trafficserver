"If the object can be written, the cache calls :arg:`contp` back with the "
"event :data:`TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_WRITE`.  In this case, the cache also "
"passes :arg:`contp` a cache vconnection and :arg:`contp` can then initiate "
"a write operation on that vconnection using :type:`TSVConnWrite`.  The "
"object is not committed to the cache until the vconnection is closed. When "
"all data has been transferred, the user (:arg:`contp`) must do an :type:"
"`TSVConnClose`.  In case of any errors, the user must do an "
"``TSVConnAbort(contp, 0)``."
