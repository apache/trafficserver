"These APIs are used to create, manage, and use UUIDs in a plugin, "
"implementing part of RFC 4122. Currently, only the V4 variant of the "
"specifications is implemented. In addition, an internal, process unique "
"UUID is provided, which can be used to uniquely identifying the running "
"Traffic Server process."

msgid ""
":func:`TSUuidCreate` creates a new :type:`TSUuid` object, which is returned "
"and can be used by the other APIs. Similarly, a read-only global process "
"UUID is returned from the function :func:`TSProcessUuidGet`. You must not "
"attempt to modify any data as returned by either of these functions."

":func:`TSUuidInitialize` initializes a :type:`TSUuid` object, using the "
"algorithm defined for the specified version. Note that only the V4 variants "
"is currently supported. You can call :func:`TSUuidInitialize` repeatedly, "
"which each generates a new UUID, but this will overwrite any existing UUID "
"data in the object. This also implies that any strings retrieved using :"
"func:`TSUuidStringGet` are also modified accordingly."

":func:`TSUuidDestroy` destroys (releases) an :type:`TSUuid` object, and "
"frees all memory associated with this object. This includes any strings as "
"returned by e.g. :func:`TSUuidStringGet`."

":func:`TSUuidCopy` copies one :type:`TSUuid` to another, making an exact "
"duplicate. Note that both the source and the destination UUIDs must be "
"created appropriately, and should not have been previously destroyed."

":func:`TSUuidVersionGet` returns the version number for the :type:`TSUuid`. "
"This will work properly for any RFC 4122 initialized UUID object, e.g. if "
"you parse a string with :func:`TSUuidStringParse` this will return the "
"correct variant ID."

":func:`TSUuidStringGet` returns a pointer to the internal string "
"representation of the :type:`TSUuid` object. It's important to know that "
"there is no transfer of ownership of this string. If you need a copy of it, "
"you are responsible of doing so yourself. In particular, using a string as "
"returned by :func:`TSUuidStringGet` **after** you have called :func:"
"`TSUuidDestroy` on the corresponding :type:`TSUuid` object is a serious "
"error. The UUID object does not do any sort of reference counting on the "
"string, and you must absolutely not free the memory as returned by this API."

"Finally, :func:`TSUuidStringParse` can be used to convert an existing :type:"
"`TSUuid` string to a Traffic Server UUID object. This will only succeed if "
"the :type:`TSUuid` string is a proper *RFC 4122* UUID. The :type:`TSUuid` "
"argument passed to this function must be a properly :func:`TSUuidCreate` "
"object, but it does not need to be previously initialized."
