"1) Set a maximum resolver chain length and declare the request instance so "
"that there is storage for state for that many resolvers. If needed and "
"additional value of maximum storage per chain could be set as well. The "
"expected number of elements in a chain is expected to be limited, 10 would "
"likely be a reaosnable limit. If settable at source configuration time this "
