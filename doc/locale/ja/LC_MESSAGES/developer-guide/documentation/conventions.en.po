"The |TS| project documentation supplies a custom styling override which "
"causes cell contents to wrap within wide tables whenever possible in cases "
"where it is necessary to prevent the content from overflowing into the "
"margin. If, however, the cell content cannot be wrapped because there are "
"no breaking spaces present (for example, a long variable name containing "
"only letters, periods, underscores, dashes, and so no, but no whitespace), "
"the table may still require overflowing into the page margin. Whenever "
"possible, please try to avoid the use of tables when presenting information "
"that will lead to this, as it greatly hampers readibility on smaller "
