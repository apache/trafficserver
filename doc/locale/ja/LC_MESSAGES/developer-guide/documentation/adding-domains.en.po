"Each domain is defined by a class which inherits from ``std.Target``. "
"Several class attributes are expected, which determine how domain object "
"definitions are processed. |TS| convention is to name each domain's class "
"in camel case, beginning with :literal:`TS` to prevent any class name "
"collisions with builtin Sphinx classes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/adding-domains.en.rst:88
msgid ""
"We have named the domain's defining class as *TSVariable* and inherited "
"from the :literal:`std.Target` class. Given the earlier stated "
"requirements, we need a domain which supports at least two required "
"attributes (a name, of course, and a URI protocol with which it is "
"associated) and a commonly defined, though optional, third attribute (a "
"data type). We'll deal with the value ranges and deprecation status later."

"We've now specified the appropriate number of required and optional "
"arguments, though not what each one happens to be or in what order the "
"required arguments need be written. Additionally, we've declared that "
"definitions using this domain do not permit whitespace in the final "
"argument, but definitions can have a block of text content which follows "
"them and should be associated with the item being defined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/adding-domains.en.rst:112
msgid ""
"Permitting whitespace in the final argument causes the final value of a "
"valid definition to *slurp* the remaining content of the definition. "
"Normally, each argument is separated by whitespace, thus ``foo bar baz`` "
"would only be a valid definition if the domain's required and optional "
"argument counts added up to exactly three. If the domain defined only two "
"arguments as expected, but sets ``final_argument_whitespace`` to *True*, "
"then the definition would be valid and the second argument in this case "
"would be ``bar baz``."

"Our requirements also state support for optional value ranges, and a flag "
"to indicate whether the variable is being deprecated. These can easily be "

"definition."
msgstr ""

"For our example, ``deprecated`` is simply a boolean flag, and ``range`` "
"will be an arbitrary string on which we will perform no particular "
"transformation or validation (good behavior will be left up to those "
"documenting their variables with this domain). The ``rst.directives`` "
"module may be consulted for a wider range of predefined option types, "
