"All documentation and related files are located in the source tree under "
"the ``doc/`` directory. Makefiles are generated automatiically by the main "
"configure script. For simplicity's sake, it is recommended that "
"contributors new to the documentation make use of the included Vagrant "
"configurations, as these will take care of providing all dependencies. "
"Please refer to the :ref:`developer-testing-with-vagrant` chapter for "
"complete details on using Vagrant to build and test the |TS| source tree."

"machine, you may access the HTML documentation files directly without the "
"need for a full-fledged web server, as all necessary resources (CSS, "
"Javascript, and images) are referenced using relative paths and there are "
"no server-side scripts necessary to render the documentation."
