"Plugins can provide tremendously useful functionality for users of |TS|, "
"but it does them little good if there are no instructions on how to use the "
"plugins properly. In the interest of encouraging useful documentation on "
"all the features available to those deploying |TS| in their infrastructure, "
"this section lays out a series of guidelines and offers a basic template "
"for adding new entries to the :ref:`admin-plugins` chapter of the :ref:"
"`admin-guide`."

"Ideally, every plugin will provide documentation covering the following "

msgid "Introduction"

"A brief section in which the plugin's core functionality is explained in a "
"quickly digestable paragraph or two. For the sake of brevity, this section "
"should omit discussion of configuration details in favor of providing a "
"more 10,000 foot view of the plugin features."

msgid ""
"Why would someone want to use this particular plugin? What problems does it "
"solve, or what features not attainable otherwise (through core "
"functionality or other plugins) does it provide to an administrator or "
"user? While not exactly a product pitch, this is the section in which the "
"case for using the plugin at all should be made."

msgid "Dependencies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:58
msgid ""
"If the plugin has external dependencies, they should be listed in full, "
"with the exception of items already required by a bare-bones |TS| build. If "
"the plugin has no unusual or non-standard dependencies, this section may be "
"safely omitted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:63
msgid ""
"For example, there is no need to list a C++ compiler as a requirement, but "
"if the plugin requires OpenCL and a specific brand of GPU expansion card to "
"perform some wacky image transformations on cached objects - that really "
"should be disclosed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:68

"If any of the dependencies are optional, that should be noted as well as "
"the functionality that may be missing should the dependency not be present."

"Detailed instructions on how to install the plugin if it is not built by "
"default with |TS| or requires any additional libraries, services, or "
"applications outside of |TS| to be present."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:78

"If the plugin is marked stable and included by default in |TS| builds, then "
"it may not be necessary to include any installation steps beyond noting "

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:85
msgid ""
"Detailed instructions on how and where to provide configuration data for "
"the plugin's features. It is important to use |RST| references for all "

"configuration files."

"of the plugin or their infrastructure's architecture."

#: ../../../developer-guide/documentation/plugins.en.rst:100
msgid ""
"If the plugin contains known limitations (perhaps it only works with some "
"protocols, can understand only some media types, or is especially non-"
"performant under specific configurations) they should be noted. If "
"possible, workarounds for these limitations should be suggested, or if none "
"are available that should be noted."

msgid ""
"Every plugin should aim to have at least one, complete example of its usage "

"Consolidated list of references to outside materials and documents which "

msgid ""
"Not all plugins will fit perfectly within that list of sections. Some may "
"require additional details, or such extended discussion that it is best to "
"break the plugin's documentation down a bit further. In general, it is "

"*Configuration* and *Caveats* or *Limitations*."

"This ordering permits a quick scanning of the plugin's purpose, basic "

"In cases where the array of configuration possibilities is extensive, it is "
"recommended that the initial *Configuration* section describe the most "
"common configuration scenario(s), while noting that there are many other "
"possibilities that will be covered in the sections that follow. This, it is "
"hoped, will get the usual case out of the way quickly for most |TS| "
"administrators while limiting the paralysis of choice they may face "
"otherwise."
