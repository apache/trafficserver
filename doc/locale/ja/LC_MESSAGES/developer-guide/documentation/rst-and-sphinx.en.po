"The |TS| documentation source files are written using |RST| (RST) markup. "
"This is a plain-text format intended to be easily readable both in its "
"source and final rendered forms. While not entirely dissimilar to other "
"plain text markup formats like Markdown, RST provides additional "
"functionality for defining internal links between documents, producing "
"tables of contents, and indices. Additionally, RST works in hand with "
"Sphinx for providing advanced features such as markup domains, of which "
"this documenentation makes extensive use."

"Both |RST| and Sphinx have official documentation resources which detail "
"their full capabilities and all markup options, as well as methods of "
"extending them with custom markup. This section will explain the most "
"common markup features used, but the following resources may be consulted "
"for further details."
