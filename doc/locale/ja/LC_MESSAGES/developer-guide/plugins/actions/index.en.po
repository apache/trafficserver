"An **action** is a handle to an operation initiated by a plugin that has "
"not yet completed. For example: when a plugin connects to a remote server, "
"it uses the call ``TSNetConnect`` - which takes ``TSCont`` as an argument "
"to call back when the connection is established. ``TSNetConnect`` might not "
"call the continuation back immediately and will return an ``TSAction`` "
"structure that the caller can use to cancel the operation. Cancelling the "
"operation does not necessarily mean that the operation will not occur; it "
"simply means that the continuation passed into the operation will not be "
"called back. In such an example, the connection might still occur if the "
"action is cancelled; however, the continuation that initiated the "
"connection would not be called back."

"In the preceding example, it is also possible that the connection will "
"complete and call back the continuation before ``TSNetConnect`` returns. If "
"that occurs, then ``TSNetConnect`` returns a special action that causes "
"``TSActionDone`` to return ``1``. This specifies that the operation has "
"already completed, so it's pointless to try to cancel the operation. Also "
"note that an action will never change from non-completed to completed. When "
"the operation actually succeeds and the continuation is called back, the "
"continuation must zero out its action pointer to indicate to itself that "
"the operation succeeded."

msgid ""
"The asynchronous nature of all operations in Traffic Server necessitates "
"actions. You should notice from the above discussion that once a call to a "
"function like ``TSNetConnect`` is made by a continuation and that function "
"returns a valid action (``TSActionDone`` returns ``0``), it is not safe for "
"the continuation to do anything else except return from its handler "
"function. It is not safe to modify or examine the continuation's data "
"because the continuation may have already been destroyed."

msgid ""
"The example above shows a simple plugin that creates a continuation and "
"then schedules it to be called immediately. When the plugin's handler "
"function is called the first time, the event is ``TS_EVENT_IMMEDIATE``. The "
"plugin then tries to open a net connection to port 9999 on ``localhost`` "
"(127.0.0.1). The IP description was left in cider notation to further "
"clarify what is going on; also note that the above won't actually compile "
"until the IP address is modified. The action returned from ``TSNetConnect`` "
"is examined by the plugin. If the operation has not completed, then the "
"plugin stores the action in its continuation. Otherwise, the plugin knows "
"it has already been called back and there is no reason to store the action "
"pointer."

msgid ""
"A final question might be, \"why would a plugin want to cancel an action?\" "
"In the above example, a valid reason could be to place a limit on the "
"length of time it takes to open a connection. The plugin could schedule "
"itself to get called back in 30 seconds and then initiate the net "
"connection. If the timeout expires first, then the plugin would cancel the "
"action. The following sample code implements this:"
