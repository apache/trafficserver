"The continuation interface is Traffic Server's basic callback mechanism. "
"**Continuations** are instances of the opaque data type ``TSCont``. In "
"its basic form, a continuation represents a handler function and a mutex."

"Before being activated, a caller must grab the continuation's mutex. This"
" requirement makes it possible for a continuation's handler function to "
"safely access its data and to prevent multiple callers from running it at"
" the same time (see the :ref:`about-the-sample-protocol` for usage). The "
"data protected by the mutex is any global or continuation data associated"
" to the continuation by ``TSContDataSet``. This does not include the "
"local data created by the continuation handler function. A typical "
"example of continuations created with associated data structures and "
"mutexes is the transaction state machine created in the sample Protocol "
"plugin (see :ref:`one-way-to-implement-a-transaction-state-machine`)."

"A reentrant call occurs when the continuation passed as an argument to "
"the API can be called in the same stack trace as the function calling the"
" API. For example, if you call ``TSCacheRead`` (``contp, mykey``), it is "
"possible that ``contp``'s handler will be called directly and then "
"``TSCacheRead`` returns."

"the reentrant call passes itself as a continuation to the reentrant API. "
"In this case, the continuation should not try to access its data after "
"calling the reentrant API. The reason for this is that data may be "
"modified by the section of code in the continuation's handler that "
"handles the event sent by the API. It is recommended that you always "
"return after a reentrant call to avoid accessing something that has been "
"deallocated."

msgid ""
"The above example first assumes that the continuation is called back with"
" ``event1``; it then does the first reentrant call that schedules the "
"continuation to receive ``event2``. Because the call is reentrant, the "
"processor calls back the continuation right away with ``event2`` and the "
"continuation is destroyed. If you try to access the continuation or one "
"of its members after the reentrant call, then you might access something "
"that has been deallocated. To avoid accessing something that has been "
"deallocated, never access the continuation or any of its members after a "
"reentrant call - just exit the handler."

"**Note:** Most HTTP transaction plugin continuations do not need non-null"
" mutexes because they're called within the processing of an HTTP "
"transaction, and therefore have the transaction's mutex."

"It is also possible to specify a continuation's mutex as ``NULL``. This "
"should be done only when registering a continuation to a global hook, by "
"a call to ``TSHttpHookAdd``. In this case, the continuation can be called"
" simultaneously by different instances of HTTP SM running on different "
"threads. Having a mutex here would slow and/or hinder Traffic Server "
"performance, since all the threads will try to lock the same mutex. The "
"drawback of not having a mutex is that such a continuation cannot have "
"data associated with it (i.e., ``TSContDataGet/Set`` cannot be used)."

msgid ""
"When using a ``NULL`` mutex it is dangerous to access the continuation's "
"data, but usually continuations with ``NULL`` mutexes have no data "
"associated with them anyway. An example of such a continuation is one "
"that gets called back every time an HTTP request is read, and then "
"determines from the request alone if the request should go through or be "
"rejected. An HTTP transaction gives its continuation data to the "
"``contp``."
