"**Global HTTP hooks** HTTP transaction hooks are set on a global basis "
"using the function ``TSHttpHookAdd``. This means that the continuation "
"specified as the parameter to ``TSHttpHookAdd`` is called for every "
"transaction. ``TSHttpHookAdd`` must be used in ``TSPluginInit``."

"**Transaction hooks** Transaction hooks can be used to call plugins back "
"for a specific HTTP transaction. You cannot add transaction hooks in "

"**Session hooks** An HTTP session starts when a client opens a connection "
"to Traffic Server and ends when the connection closes. A session can "
"consist of several transactions. Session hooks enable you to hook your "
"plugin to a particular point in every transaction within a specified "
"session (see :doc:`HTTP Sessions <http-sessions.en>`). Session hooks are "
"added in a manner similar to transaction hooks (ie, you first need a handle "
"to an HTTP session)."

"**HTTP select alternate hook** Alternate selection hooks enable you to hook "

"Selection <http-alternate-selection.en>` for information on the alternate "
