"An **HTTP session** is an object that is defined for the lifetime of a "
"client's TCP session. The Traffic Server API enables you to add a global "
"hook to the start or end of an HTTP session, as well as add session hooks "
"that call back your plugin for every transaction within a given session. "
"When a client connects to Traffic Server, it opens up a TCP connection and "
"sends one or more HTTP requests. An individual request and its response "
"comprise the HTTP transaction. The **HTTP session** begins when the client "
"opens the connection and ends when the connection closes."
