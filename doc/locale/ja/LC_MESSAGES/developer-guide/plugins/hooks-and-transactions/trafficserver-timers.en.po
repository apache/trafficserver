"Traffic Server runs a variety of timers at various states of a transaction. "
"Typically, a given transaction may include upto two connections (one on the "
"UA/client side and the other on the Origin side). Traffic Server supports "
"two kinds of timers \"Active\" and \"Inactive\" timers for each side "
"respectively, as applicable at a given state. The below picture illustrates "
"the specific timers run at various states in the current implementation. "
"The picture only depicts the HTTP transaction level timers and does not "
"include the TLS handshake states and other more detailed/internal timers in "
"each individual state."
