"The ``TSfopen`` family of routines is not intended for high speed IO or "

"thread for doing the blocking IO. The ``TSfopen`` family is intended for "

"The ``fopen`` family of functions in C is normally used for reading "
"configuration files, since ``fgets`` is an easy way to parse files on a "
"line-by-line basis. The ``TSfopen`` family of functions aims at solving the "
"same problem of buffered IO and line at a time IO in a platform-independent "
"manner. The ``fopen`` family of C library functions can only open a file if "
"a file descriptor less than 256 is available. Since Traffic Server often "
"has more than 2000 file descriptors open at once, however, the likelihood "
"of an available file descriptor less than 256 very small. To solve this "
"problem, the ``TSfopen`` family can open files with descriptors greater "
"than 256."

"There are two main reasons for using the routines provided by Traffic "
"Server. The first is portability: the Traffic Server API routines behave "
"the same on all of Traffic Server's supported platforms. For example, "
"``realloc`` does not accept an argument of ``NULL`` on some platforms. The "
"second reason is that the Traffic Server routines actually track the memory "
"allocations by file and line number. This tracking is very efficient, "
"always turned on, and quite useful when tracking down memory leaks."
