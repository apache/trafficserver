"A ``VConnection`` is an abstraction for a data pipe that allows its users "
"to perform asynchronous reads and writes without knowing the underlying "
"implementation. A transformation is a specific type of ``VConnection``. A "
"**transformation** connects an input data source and an output data sink; "
"this feature enables it to view and modify all the data passing through it."

"A ``VIO`` is a description of an IO operation that is in progress. Every "
"``VConnection`` has an associated *input VIO* and an associated *output "
"VIO*. When ``VConnection``\\ s are transferring data to one another, one "
"``VConnection``'s input ``VIO`` is another ``VConnection``'s output "
"``VIO``. A ``VConnection``'s input ``VIO`` is also called its **write "
"``VIO``** because the input ``VIO`` refers to a write operation performed "
"on the ``VConnection`` itself. Similarly, the output ``VIO`` is also called "
"the **read ``VIO``**. For transformations, which are designed to pass data "
"in one direction, you can picture the relationship between the "
"transformation ``VConnection`` and its ``VIO``\\ s as follows:"

"Content transformation plugins transform HTTP response content (such as "

"Because the Traffic Server API places transformations directly in the "
"response or request data stream, the transformation ``VConnection`` is "
"responsible only for reading the data from the input buffer, transforming "
"it, and then writing it to the output buffer. The upstream ``VConnection`` "
"writes the incoming data to the transformation's input buffer. In the "
"figure above, :ref:`TransformationAndItsVIOs`, the input ``VIO`` describes "
"the progress of the upstream ``VConnection``'s write operation on the "
"transformation, while the output ``VIO`` describes the progress of the "
"transformation's write operation on the output (downstream) "
"``VConnection``. The **nbytes** value in the ``VIO`` is the total number of "
"bytes to be written. The **ndone** value is the current progress, or the "
"number of bytes that have been written at a specific point in time."

"The **IO buffer** data structure is the building block of the "
"``VConnection`` abstraction. An IO buffer is composed of a list of buffer "
"blocks which, in turn, point to buffer data. Both the *buffer block* "
"(``TSIOBufferBlock``) and *buffer data* (``TSIOBufferData``) data "
"structures are reference counted so they can reside in multiple buffers at "
"the same time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one IO "
"buffer to another using ``TSIOBufferCopy``, since Traffic Server only needs "
"to copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately (instead of "
"actually copying any data)."

"Transformations can be chained together, one after the other, so that "

"``VConnection`` type, ``TSVConn``, is actually a subclass of ``TSCont``, "
"which means that ``VConnection``\\ s (and transformations) are "
"continuations. ``VConnection``\\ s and transformations can thus exchange "
"events, informing one another that data is available for reading or "

"When writing a transformation plugin, you must understand implementation as "

"must be able to handle the events that the upstream and downstream "
"``VConnection``\\ s send to it. The *user's side* refers to how to use a "

"For the latter it is important to note that if all consumers of a "

"completion even if the user agent disconnects. Examples would be a standard "
