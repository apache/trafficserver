"The default behavior for transformations is to cache the transformed "
"content (you can also tell Traffic Server to cache untransformed content, "
"if you want). Therefore, only responses received directly from an origin "
"server need to be transformed. Objects served from cache are already "
"transformed. To determine whether the response is from the origin server, "
"the routine ``transformable`` checks the response header for the \"200 OK\" "
