"The sample remap plugin, ``query_remap.c``, maps client requests to a "
"number of servers based on a hash of the request's URL query parameter. "
"This can be useful for spreading load for a given type of request among "
"backend servers, while still maintaining \"stickiness\" to a single server "
"for similar requests. For example, a search engine may want to send "
"repeated queries for the same keywords to a server that has likely cached "
"the result from a prior query."

"The query remap plugin will allow the query parameter name to be specified, "
"along with the hostnames of the servers to hash across. Sample ``remap."

"The first ``@pparam`` specifies the query param key for which the value "
"will be hashed. The remaining parameters list the hostnames of the servers. "
"A request for ``http://www.example.com/search?q=apache`` will match the "
"first rule. The plugin will look for the *``q``* parameter and hash the "
"value '``apache``\\ ' to pick from among ``srch_[1-3]_.example.com`` to "
"send the request."

"If the request does not include a *``q``* query parameter and the plugin "

"The parameters are passed to the plugin's ``tsremap_new_instance`` "
"function. In ``query_remap``, ``tsremap_new_instance`` creates a plugin-"
"defined ``query_remap_info`` struct to store its configuration parameters. "
"The ihandle, an opaque pointer that can be used to pass per-instance data, "
"is set to this struct pointer and will be passed to the ``tsremap_remap`` "
"function when it is triggered for a request."
