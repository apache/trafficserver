"Proxy authorization ``required`` status code back to the client. The client "

"If ``handle_dns`` does not find the ``Proxy-Authorization`` field set to "
"Basic authorization or a valid username/password, then it adds a "
"``SEND_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK`` to the transaction being processed. This means "
"that Traffic Server will call the plugin back when sending the client "
"response. ``handle_dns`` reenables the transaction with "
"``TS_EVENT_HTTP_ERROR``, which means that the plugin wants Traffic Server "
"to terminate the transaction."

"When Traffic Server terminates the transaction, it sends the client an "
"error message. Because of the ``SEND_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK``, Traffic Server "
"calls the plugin back. The ``auth-plugin`` routine calls "
"``handle_response`` to send the client a ``407`` status code. When the "
"client resends the request with the ``Proxy-Authorization`` field, a new "
"transaction begins."

"``handle_dns`` calls ``base64_decode`` to decode the username and password; "
"``handle_dns`` also calls ``authorized`` to validate the username and "
"password. In this plugin, sample NT code is provided for password "
"validation. UNIX programmers can supply their own validation mechanism."
