msgid ""
"The sample basic authorization plugin, ``basic-auth.c``, checks for basic "
"HTTP proxy authorization. In HTTP basic proxy authorization, client user "
"names and passwords are contained in the ``Proxy-Authorization`` header. "
"The password is encoded using base64 encoding. The plugin checks all "
"incoming requests for the authorization header, user name, and password. If "
"the plugin does not find all of the these, then it reenables with an error "
"(effectively stopping the transaction) and adds a transaction hook to the "
"send response header event."

"Authorization plugins which attach to ``TS_HTTP_OS_DNS_HOOK`` (as shown in "
"the example above) will not operate as expected unless :ts:cv:`proxy.config."
"http.doc_in_cache_skip_dns` is set to ``0``. Disabling this feature ensures "
"that DNS hooks will still be executed even when a matching document has "
"been located in the cache. The downside is that the performance gain by "
"skipping otherwise unnecessary DNS lookups is lost."
