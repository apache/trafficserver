"This chapter describes how to add statistics to your plugins. Statistics "
"can be coupled or uncoupled. *Coupled* statistics are quantities that are "
"related and must therefore be updated together. The Traffic Server API "
"statistics functions add your plugin's statistics to the Traffic Server "
"statistics system. You can view your plugin statistics as you would any "
"other Traffic Server statistic, using Traffic Line (Traffic Server's "
"command line interface). This chapter contains the following topics:"

"As a very simple example, suppose you have three statistics: ``sum``, "

"The mechanism for updating coupled statistics jointly is to create local "

"``TSStatsCoupledUpdate``. To specify which statistics are related to one "
"another, establish a coupled statistic category and make sure that each "
