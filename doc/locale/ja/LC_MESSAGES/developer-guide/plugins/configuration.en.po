"The collection of ``TSConfig*`` functions are designed to provide a fast "
"and efficient mechanism for accessing and changing global configuration "
"information within a plugin. Such a mechanism is simple enough to provide "
"in a single-threaded program, but the translation to a multi-threaded "
"program such as |TS| is difficult. A common technique is to have a single "
"mutex protect the global configuration information; however, the problem "
"with this solution is that a single mutex becomes a performance bottleneck "
"very quickly."

"These functions define an interface to storing and retrieving an opaque "
"data pointer. Internally, |TS| maintains reference count information about "
"the data pointer so that a call to :c:func:`TSConfigSet` will not disturb "
"another thread using the current data pointer. The philosophy is that once "
"a user has a hold of the configuration pointer, it is okay for it to be "
"used even if the configuration changes. All that a user typically wants is "
"a non-changing snapshot of the configuration. You should use :c:func:"
"`TSConfigSet` for all global data updates."
