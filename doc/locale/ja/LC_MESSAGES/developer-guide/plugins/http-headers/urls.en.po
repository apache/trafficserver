"The scheme names above are defined in ``ts.h`` as ``const`` ``char*`` "
"strings. When Traffic Server sets the scheme portion of the URL (or any "
"portion for that matter), it quickly checks to see if the new value is one "
"of the known values. If it is, then it stores a pointer into a global table "
"(instead of storing the known value in the marshal buffer). The scheme "
"values listed above are also pointers into this table. This allows simple "
"pointer comparison of the value returned from ``TSUrlSchemeGet`` with one "
"of the values listed above. You should use the Traffic Server-defined "
"values when referring to one of the known schemes, since doing so can "
"prevent the possibility of spelling errors."
