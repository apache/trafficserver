"It's not safe to assume that string data contained in marshal buffers (such "
"as URLs and MIME fields) is stored in null-terminated string copies. "
"Therefore, your plugins should always use the length parameter when "
"retrieving or manipulating these strings. You **cannot** pass in ``NULL`` "
"for string-length return values; string values returned from marshall "
"buffers are not null-terminated. If you need a null-terminated value, then "
"use ``TSstrndup`` to automatically null-terminate a string. The strings "
"that come back and are not null-terminated **cannot** be passed into the "
"common ``str*()`` routines"

msgid ""
"MIME headers can contain more than one MIME field with the same name. "
"Earlier versions of Traffic Server joined multiple fields with the same "
"name into one field with composite values. This behavior came at a "
"performance cost and caused interoperability problems with older clients "
"and servers. Therefore, this version of Traffic Server does not coalesce "
"duplicate fields."

"When using Traffic Server, you cannot create a new MIME field without an "

"of a MIME header or HTTP header."

msgid ""
"To use a MIME field, you must specify the MIME header or HTTP header to "
"which it belongs - this is called the field's **parent header**. The "
"``TSMimeField*`` functions in older versions of the SDK have been "
"deprecated, as they do not require the parent header as inputs. The current "
"version of Traffic Server uses new functions, the **``TSMimeHdrField``** "
"series, which require you to specify the location of the parent header "
"along with the location of the MIME field. For every deprecated "
"*``TSMimeField``* function, there is a new, preferred ``TSMimeHdrField*`` "
"function. Therefore, you should use the **``TSMimeHdrField``** functions "
"instead of the deprecated *``TSMimeField``* series. Examples are provided "
"below."

"When you fetch a component object or create a new object, you get back a "
"handle to the object location. The handle is either an ``TSMLoc`` for an "
