"A VConnection implementor writes only transformations. All other "
"VConnections (net VConnections and cache VConnections) are implemented in "
"iocore. As mentioned earlier, a given vconnection can have a maximum of one "
"read operation and one write operation being performed on it. The "
"vconnection user gets information about the operation being performed by "
"examining the VIO returned by a call to ``TSVConnRead`` or "
"``TSVConnWrite``. The implementor, in turn, gets a handle on the VIO "
"operation by examining the VIO returned by ``TSVConnReadVIOGet`` or "
"``TSVConnWriteVIOGet`` (recall that every vconnection created through the "
"Traffic Server API has an associated read VIO and write VIO, even if it "
"only supports reading or writing)."

"A vconnection is a continuation. This means it has a handler function that "
"is run when an event is sent to it, or more accurately, when an event that "
"was sent to it is received. It is the handler function's job to examine the "
"event, the current state of its read VIO and write VIO, and any other "
"internal state the vconnection might have and potentially make some "
"progress on the IO operations."

"It is common for the handler function for all vconnections to look similar. "
"Their basic form looks something like the code fragment below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer-guide/plugins/io/transformations.en.rst:73
msgid ""
"This code fragment basically shows that many vconnections simply want to "
"destroy themselves when they are closed. However, the situation might also "
"require the vconnection to do some cleanup processing - which is why "
"``TSVConnClose`` does not simply just destroy the vconnection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer-guide/plugins/io/transformations.en.rst:78
msgid ""
"Vconnections are state machines that are animated by the events they "
"receive. An event is sent to the vconnection whenever an ``TSVConnRead``, "
"``TSVConnWrite``, ``TSVConnClose``, ``TSVConnShutdown``, or "
"``TSVIOReenable`` call is performed. ``TSVIOReenable`` indirectly "
"references the vconnection through a back-pointer in the VIO structure to "
"the vconnection. The vconnection itself only knows which call was performed "
"by examining its state and the state of its VIOs. For example, when "
"``TSVConnClose`` is called, the vconnection is sent an immediate event "
"(``TS_EVENT_IMMEDIATE``). For every event the vconnection receives, it "
"needs to check its closed flag to see if it has been closed. Similarly, "
"when ``TSVIOReenable`` is called, the vconnection is sent an immediate "
"event. For every event the vconnection receives, it must check its VIOs to "
"see if the buffers have been modified to a state in which it can continue "
"processing one of its operations."

msgid ""
"Finally, a vconnection is likely the user of other vconnections. It also "
"receives events as the user of these other vconnections. When it receives "
"such an event, like ``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_READY``, it might just enable "
"another vconnection that's writing into the buffer used by the vconnection "
"reading from it. The above description is merely intended to give the "
"overall idea for what a vconnection needs to do."

"A :ref:`transformation <transformations>` is a specific type of "
"vconnection. It supports a subset of the vconnection functionality that "
"enables one or more transformations to be chained together. A "
"transformation sits as a bottleneck between an input data source and an "
"output data sink, which enables it to view and modify all the data passing "
"through it. Alternatively, some transformations simply scan the data and "
"pass it on. A common transformation is one that compresses data in some "
"manner."

"A transformation can modify either the data stream being sent *to* an HTTP "
"client (e.g. the document) or the data stream being sent *from* an HTTP "
"client (e.g. post data). To do this, the transformation should hook on to "
"one of the following hooks:"

msgid ""
"Note that because a transformation is intimately associated with a given "
"transaction, it is only possible to add the hook to the transaction hooks - "
"not to the global or session hooks. Transformations reside in a chain, so "
"their ordering is quite easily determined: transformations that add "
"themselves to the chain are simply appended to it."

"Data is passed in to the transformation by initiating a vconnection write "
"operation on the transformation. As a consequence of this design, a "
"transformation must support the vconnection write operation. In other "
"words, your transformation must expect an upstream vconnection to write "
"data to it. The transformation has to read the data, consume it, and tell "
"the upstream vconnection it is finished by sending it an "
"``TS_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE`` event. Transformations cannot send the "
"``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_COMPLETE`` event to the upstream vconnection unless "
"they are finished consuming all incoming data. If "
"``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_COMPLETE`` is sent prematurely, then certain "
"internal Traffic Server data structures will not be deallocated, thereby "
"causing a memory leak."

"Before sending ``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_COMPLETE``, your transformation "

"This value should go to zero when all of the upstream data is consumed "
"(``TSVIONTodoGet = nbytes - ndone``). Do not send "

"The transformation passes data out of itself by using the output "
"vconnection retrieved by ``TSTransformOutputVConnGet``. Immediately before "
"Traffic Server initiates the write operation (which inputs data into the "
"transformation), it sets the output vconnection either to the next "
"transformation in the chain of transformations or to a special terminating "
"transformation (if it's the last transformation in the chain). Since the "
"transformation is handed ownership of the output vconnection, it must close "
"it at some point in order for it to be deallocated."

"All of the transformations in a transformation chain share the "
"transaction's mutex. This small restriction (enforced by "
"``TSTransformCreate``) removes many of the locking complications of "
"implementing general vconnections. For example, a transformation does not "
"have to grab its write VIO mutex before accessing its write VIO because it "
"knows it already holds the mutex."
