"A **VIO**, or **virtual IO**, is a description of an IO operation that's "
"currently in progress. The VIO data structure is used by vconnection users "
"to determine how much progress has been made on a particular IO operation "
"and to re-enable an IO operation when it stalls due to buffer space issues. "
"VIOs are used by vconnection implementors to determine the buffer for an IO "
"operation, how much work to do on the IO operation, and which continuation "
"to call back when progress on the IO operation is made."
