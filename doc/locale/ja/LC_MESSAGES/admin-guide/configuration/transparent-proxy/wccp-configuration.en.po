"Use of WCCP only makes sense for client side transparency [1]_ because if "

"|image1| The router will **not** respond to WCCP protocol packets unless "
"explicitly configured to do so. Via WCCP, the router can be made to perform "
"packet interception and redirection needed by Traffic Server transparency. "

"policy routing with positive heartbeat cutoff."

"Finally Traffic Server itself must be configured for transparency and use "

"The basic concept for a shared interface is to use a tunnel to simulate the "
"dedicated interface case. This enables the packets to be distinguished at "
"layer 3. For this reason, layer 2 redirection cannot be used because the "
"WCCP configuration cannot distinguish between packets returning from the "
"origin server and packets returning from Traffic Server as they are "
"distinguished only by layer 2 addressing [3]_. Fortunately the GRE tunnel "
"used for packet forwarding and return can be used as the simulated "

"In most cases the basic configuration using a tunnel in any topology can "

"This can lead to pathological behavior or outright failure as the packets "
