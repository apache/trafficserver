"|image1| The router will **not** respond to WCCP protocol packets unless "

"The basic concept for a shared interface is to use a tunnel to simulate the "

"origin server and packets returning from Traffic Server as they are "
"distinguished only by layer 2 addressing [3]_. Fortunately the GRE tunnel "

"In most cases the basic configuration using a tunnel in any topology can "

"This can lead to pathological behavior or outright failure as the packets "
