"We mark packets so that we can use policy routing on them. For inbound "
"packets we use ``TPROXY`` to make it possible to accept packets sent to "
"foreign IP addresses. For returning outbound packets there will be a socket "
"open bound to the foreign address, we need only force it to be delivered "
"locally. The value for ``--on-ip`` is 0 because the target port is "
"listening and not bound to a specific address. The value for ``--on-port`` "
"must match the Traffic Server server port. Otherwise its value is "
"arbitrary. ``--dport`` and ``--sport`` specify the port from the point of "
"view of the clients and origin servers. The middle two lines exempt local "
"web traffic from being marked for Traffic Server -- these rules can be "
"tightened or loosened as needed. They server by matching traffic and "
"exiting the ``iptables`` processing via ``ACCEPT`` before the last line is "
"checked."
