"assignment – WCCP supports multiple WCCP clients supporting a single "
"service group.  However, the current WCCP client implementation in Traffic "
"Server assumes there is only a single WCCP client, and so creates "
"assignment tables that will direct all traffic to that WCCP client.  The "
"assignment type is either hash or mask, and if it is not set, it defaults "
"to hash.  If Traffic Server ever supports more than one cache, it will "
"likely only support a balanced hash assignment.  The mask/value assignment "
"seems to be better suited to situations where the traffic needs to be more "
"strongly controlled."

"primary-hash – This is the element of the packet that is used to compute "
"the primary key.  The value options are src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, or  "
"dst_port. This entry is a list, so multiple values can be specified.  In "
"that case, all the specified packet attributes will be used to compute the "
"hash bucket.  In the current implementation, the primary hash value does "
"not matter, since the client always generates a hash table that directs all "
"matching traffic to it.  But if multiple clients are ever supported, "
"knowledge of the local traffic distribution could be used to pick a packet "
"attribute that will better spread traffic over the WCCP clients."

"alt-hash – The protocol supports a two level hash.  This attribute is a "
