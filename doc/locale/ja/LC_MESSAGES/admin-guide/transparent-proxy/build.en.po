"Enable TPROXY support, which is the Linux kernel feature used for "
"transparency. This should be present in the base installation, there is "
"no package associated with it. \\* ``auto`` Do automatic checks for the "
"the TPROXY header file (``linux/in.h``) and enable TPROXY support if the "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT`` definition is present. This is the default if this "
"option is not specified or ``value`` is omitted. \\* ``no`` Do not check "
"for TPROXY support, disable support for it. \\* ``force`` Do not check "
"for TPROXY support, enable it using the $ats@ built in value for "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT``. This is useful for systems that have it in the kernel"
" for but some reason do not have the appropriate system header file. \\* "
"*number* Do not check for TPROXY support, use *number* as the "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT`` value. There are, at present, no known standard "
"distributions of Linux that support TPROXY but use a value different from"
" the built in ATS default. However, a custom built kernel may do so and "
"in that case the specific value can be specified."

"In the default case, ATS configuration will automatically check for "
"TPROXY support via the presence of the ``linux/in.h`` header file and "
"compile in TPROXY support if it is available. If that fails, you may be "
"able to recover by using one of the options above. Note that transparency"
" may be built in by default but it is not active unless explicitly "
"enabled in the ATS configuration files."
