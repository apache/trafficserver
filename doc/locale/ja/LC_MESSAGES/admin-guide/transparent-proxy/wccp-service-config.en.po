"The service definition file is used by :ref:`traffic_wccp` and :ref:"
"`traffic-server` directly. The elements in the security definition file are "
"inspired by the `WCCP RFC (8/2012) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-"
"mclaggan-wccp-v2rev1-00>`_.  There is also an older version of the RFC that "
"shows up commonly in search results, `WCCP (4/2001) <https://tools.ietf.org/"
"id/draft-wilson-wrec-wccp-v2-01.txt>`_, and was the RFC reference used in "
"the original WCCP support for Traffic Server several years ago."

"group 101 defined for packets with source port 1024.  For a packet with "

"assignment – WCCP supports multiple WCCP clients supporting a single "
"service group.  However, the current WCCP client implementation in Traffic "
"Server assumes there is only a single WCCP client, and so creates "
"assignment tables that will direct all traffic to that WCCP client.  The "
"assignment type is either hash or mask, and if it is not set, it defaults "
"to hash.  If Traffic Server ever supports more than one cache, it will "
"likely only support a balanced hash assignment.  The mask/value assignment "
"seems to be better suited to situations where the traffic needs to be more "
"strongly controlled."

"primary-hash – This is the element of the packet that is used to compute "
"the primary key.  The value options are src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, or  "
"dst_port. This entry is a list, so multiple values can be specified.  In "
"that case, all the specified packet attributes will be used to compute the "
"hash bucket.  In the current implementation, the primary hash value does "
"not matter, since the client always generates a hash table that directs all "
"matching traffic to it.  But if multiple clients are ever supported, "
"knowledge of the local traffic distribution could be used to pick a packet "
"attribute that will better spread traffic over the WCCP clients."

"alt-hash – The protocol supports a two level hash.  This attribute is a "
