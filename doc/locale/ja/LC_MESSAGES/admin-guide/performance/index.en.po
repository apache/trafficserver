"Attempts to tune a system without being able to compare the impact of "
"changes made will at best result in haphazard, *feel good* results that may "
"end up having no real world impact on your customers' experiences, and at "
"worst may even result in lower performance than before you started. "
"Additionally, in the all too common situation of budget constraints, having "
"proper measurements of existing performance will greatly ease the process "
"of focusing on those individual components that, should they require "
"hardware expenditures or larger investments of employee time, have the "
"highest potential gains relative to their cost."

"TS| and we attempt to document as many of them as possible in the sections "

"One of the most important aspects of any attempt to optimize the "
"performance of a |TS| installation is the ability to measure that "
"installation's performance; both prior to and after any changes are made. "
"To that end, it is strongly recommended that you establish some means to "
"monitor and record a variety of performance metrics: request and response "
"speed, latency, and throughput; memory and CPU utilization; and storage I/O "
"operations."

"If error responses are costly for your origin server to generate, you may "
"elect to have |TS| cache these responses for a period of time. The default "
"behavior is to consider all of these responses to be uncacheable, which "
