"Attempts to tune a system without being able to compare the impact of "
"changes made will at best result in haphazard, *feel good* results that may "
"end up having no real world impact on your customers' experiences, and at "
"worst may even result in lower performance than before you started. "
"Additionally, in the all too common situation of budget constraints, having "
"proper measurements of existing performance will greatly ease the process "
"of focusing on those individual components that, should they require "
"hardware expenditures or larger investments of employee time, have the "
"highest potential gains relative to their cost."
