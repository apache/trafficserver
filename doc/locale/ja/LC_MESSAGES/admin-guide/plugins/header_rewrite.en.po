msgid "Purpose"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:31
msgid ""
"Remapping an incoming client request to an origin server is at the heart of "
"what we use |TS| for, but often we need to do more to requests than just "
"change their destination according to simple rewriting rules against the "
"URL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:35
msgid ""
"We may need to direct requests to different origins based on a client "
"cookie."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:37
msgid ""
"Our origins might return error response codes which are a little too "
"customized and we want to condense the possible values to just the official "
"codes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:40
msgid ""
"We might want to strip a set of internal-use or debugging related HTTP "
"headers from responses before sending them to clients, unless the original "
"request had its own special header indicating that they should be retained."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:44
msgid ""
"Or perhaps we want to redirect certain requests differently when they come "
"from a known group of IP addresses (say, our developers' office network) "
"and we have a file on our proxy caching servers called ``/var/"
"developertesting``. (Stranger QA methods exist.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.rst:49
msgid ""
"Maybe we want to deny access to a resource with an HTTP 403 if the client "
"connected to |TS| over a particular port, used ``HEAD`` instead of ``GET``, "
"doesn't list Spanish (Paraguay dialect) in their ``Accept-Language`` "
"header, and either the origin server replied with 304 or we randomly "
"generate an integer between 0 and 500 and get back anything greater than "
"290."
