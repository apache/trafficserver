"There are many ways of authorizing an HTTP request. Often, this requires "

"Note that the authorization request will need to match a remap rule (which, "
"as a standalone remap rule, does not need to call the AuthProxy plugin). If "
"a second remap rule is required, by default, the authorization request will "
"not have the same Host header as the request from the client. It could be "
"added using the ``header_rewrite`` plugin (set-header Host \"pristine_host."
