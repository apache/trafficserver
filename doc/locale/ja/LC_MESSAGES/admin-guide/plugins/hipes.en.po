"There can be significant overhead using HIPES because the data can traverse "

"header returned by the services. Another way to reduce traffic through ATS "
"is to have ATS to return 302 redirects to url for the requests made by "
"service, instead of proxying the requests to that url. However, the service "
"must then be able to follow the redirect. The down side is that we cannot "
"use ATS to cache intermediate results. Below is an example of using "
