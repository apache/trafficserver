"This plugin checks a signature query string on a URL and rejects (HTTP "
"``403``) or redirects (HTTP ``302``) when the check fails. The signature is "
"based on a secret key that both a signing portal and the |TS| cache share. "
"The algorithm for the signature may be either ``MD5`` or ``SHA1``. When the "
"signature check passes, the query string of the request is stripped and "
"continues to process as if there were no query string at all."
