msgid "Purpose"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:31
msgid ""
"|TS| provides a plethora of configuration options, but specifying the "
"values of those options in :file:`records.config` is global. All requests, "
"regardless of the cache object or its origin, will be evaluated within the "
"same collection of settings. Sometimes you may want |TS| to behave "
"differently for portions of your cache."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:37
msgid ""
"Perhaps you have :ref:`admin-negative-response-caching` enabled, but you "
"wish to greatly reduce the validity times for just one of your origin "
"servers while allowing the rest of your origins to have their errors cached "
"for long durations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:42
msgid ""
"Or maybe you make use of :ref:`admin-heuristic-expiration` but require "
"different fuzz times for various objects because of the nature of their "
"content and expected lifetimes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:46
msgid ""
"Any configuration directive which is overridable can be modified on a per-"
"map basis with this plugin. This opens up a level of flexibility in your "
"configurations for effectively managing and caching content with varied "
"needs, without having to resort to multiple |TS| instances."

msgid "Installation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:54
msgid ""
"This plugin is considered stable and is included with |TS| by default. "
"There are no special steps necessary for its installation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:60
msgid ""
"Configuration of this plugin is performed alongside the actual remapping "
"rules which trigger the desired configuration directive changes. There are "
"two methods available for specifying the actual directives and their "
"modified values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:66
msgid "Inline Directives"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:68
msgid ""
"In cases where you have very few remapping rules which modify directives, "
"and they are modifying only a small number of directives, you may find it "
"easiest to simply specify those directive changes in-line with your "
"remapping rules. This is done by specifying *key* = *value* pairs, where "
"the key is the configuration directive name and the value is its desired "
"setting for the remapping rule."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:75
msgid ""
"For example, the enable :ts:cv:`proxy.config.url_remap.pristine_host_hdr` "
"for a single `map` rule, you would add the following to your :file:`remap."
"config`::"

msgid "External Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:84
msgid ""
"There may be situations in which you have many directives you wish to "
"modify, or where multiple remapping rules perform the same directive "
"changes. External configurations can simplify management of these rules, "
"and help to reduce the possibility of transcription errors, or keeping all "
"the directive settings in sync across all the remapping rules over time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/conf_remap.en.rst:90
msgid ""
"Instead of specifying the directives and their values in :file:`remap."
"config` as you do with the in-line method, you place all the affected "
"directives in a separate text file. The location and name is entirely up to "
"you, but we'll use `/etc/trafficserver/cdn_conf_remap.config` here. The "
"contents of this file should mirror how configuration directives are "
"written in :file:`records.config`::"

"Your :file:`remap.config` will then contain remapping rules that point to "

msgid ""
"This plugin can only modify the values for those configuration directives "
"which are *overridable*, meaning they are not fixed upon |TS| startup. "
"While this generally shouldn't prove too onerous a restriction, you should "
"consult the individual directives' documentation to confirm whether they "
"may be overridden."
