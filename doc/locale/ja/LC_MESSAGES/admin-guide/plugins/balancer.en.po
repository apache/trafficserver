msgid ""
"The ``balancer`` balances requests across multiple origin servers. To use "
"this plugin, configure it in a :file:`remap.config` rule, specifying a "
"balancing policy and a set of origin servers. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``replacement`` URL in the mapping rule is not used. The argument to "
"the ``--policy`` option is a comma-separated list of keywords. The first "
"keyword is the name of a balancing policy. The subsequent keywords are used "
"to refine the requested policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/balancer.en.rst:36

"The remaining plugin arguments are balancer targets. Typically, these will "
"be the host names of origin servers that requests should be balanced "
"across. The target name may contain a colon-separated port number."

msgid "Hash Balancing Policy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/balancer.en.rst:44
msgid ""
"The ``hash`` balancing policy performs a consistent hash across the set of "
"origins. This minimizes the number of hash entries that must be moved when "
"the set of origin servers changes. An optional list of hash fields follows "
"the ``hash`` keyword. Each specified hash field is hashed to select an "
"outbound origin server."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/balancer.en.rst:70

"The ``roundrobin`` balancing policy simply allocates requests to origin "
"servers in order. Over time, the number of requests received by each origin "
"should be approximately the same."

msgid "Health Checking"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/balancer.en.rst:77
msgid ""
"The ``balancer`` plugin does not check the health of the origin servers, "
"however the plugin is fully reloadable so health checking is usually simple "
"to implement. Most production environments already have mechanisms to check "
"service health. It is recommended that you write a simple script to monitor "
"this information and rewrite :file:`remap.config` when appropriate. "
"Running :option:`traffic_ctl config reload` will reload the ``balancer`` "
"plugin with the new set of origin servers."
