msgid ""
"This plugin allows for the creation of rules which match regular "
"expressions against mapped URLs to determine if and when a cache object "
"revalidation should be forced."

msgid "Purpose"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:32
msgid ""
"This plugin's intended use is the selective forcing of revalidations on "
"cache objects which are not yet marked as stale in |TS| but which may have "
"been updated at the origin - without needing to alter cache control "
"headers, pre-emptively purge the object from the cache manually, or adjust "
"the global cache revalidation settings (such as fuzz times) used by other "
"plugins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:38
msgid ""
"Forced cache revalidations may be as specifically or loosely targeted as a "
"regular expression against your origin URLs permits. Thus, individual cache "
"objects may have rules created for them, or entire path prefixes, or even "
"any cache objects with a particular file extension."

"This plugin is enabled via the :file:`plugin.config` configuration file, "
"with two required arguments: the path to a rules file, and the path to a "
"log file::"

msgid ""
"The rule configuration file format is described below in `Revalidation "
"Rules`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:61
msgid ""
"The plugin regularly (every 60 seconds) checks its rules configuration file "
"for changes. If the file has been modified since its last scan, the "
"contents are read and the in-memory rules list is updated. Thus, new rules "
"may be added and existing ones modified without requiring a service restart "
"every time (as long as the delay of up to 60 seconds is acceptable)."

msgid "Revalidation Rules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:70

"Inside your revalidation rules configuration, each rule line is defined as "
"a regular expression followed by an integer which expresses the epoch time "
"at which the rule will expire::"

"PCRE style regular expressions are supported and should be used to match "
"against the complete remapped URL of cache objects (not the original client-"
"side URL), including protocol scheme and origin server domain."

msgid "Rule Expiration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:88
msgid ""
"Every rule must have an expiration associated with it. The rule expiration "
"is expressed as an integer of seconds since epoch (equivalent to the return "
"value of :manpage:`time(2)`), after which the forced revalidation will no "
"longer occur."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/plugins/regex_revalidate.en.rst:99
msgid ""
"The regular expressions in revalidation rules see only the final, remapped "
"URL in a transaction. As such, they cannot be used to distinguish between "
"two client-facing URLs which are mapped to the same origin object. This is "
"due to the fact that the plugin uses :c:data:"
"`TS_HTTP_CACHE_LOOKUP_COMPLETE_HOOK`."

"While new rules are added dynamically (the configuration file is checked "
"every 60 seconds for changes), rule lines removed from the configuration "
"file do not currently lead to that rule being removed from the running "
"plugin. In these cases, if the rule must be taken out of service, a service "
"restart may be necessary."
