"This allows you to configure mapping rules based on regular expressions. "
"This is similar to what you can accomplish using mod_rewrite in Apache "
"httpd, but obviously not as flexible or sophisticated (yet)."

"The file name parameter is always required. Unless an absolute path is "
"specified, the file name is assumed to be a path relative to the Traffic "
"Server configuration directory."

"The regular expressions listed in the configuration file are evaluated "
"sequentially. When a regular expression is positively matched against a "
"request URL, evaluation is stopped and the rewrite rule is applied. If "
"none of the regular expressions are a match, the default destination URL "
"is applied (``http://b.com`` in the example above)."

"Profiling is very low overhead, and the information is dumped to "
"``traffic.out``, located in the log directory. This information is useful"
" to optimize the order of your regular expression, such that the most "
"common matches appears early in the file. In order to force a profile "
