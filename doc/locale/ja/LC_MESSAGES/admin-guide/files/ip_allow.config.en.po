"where src_ip is the IP address or range of IP addresses of the client(s). "
"The action ``ip_allow`` enables the specified client(s) to access the "
"Traffic Server proxy cache, and ``ip_deny`` denies the specified client(s) "
"to access the Traffic Server proxy cache. Multiple method keywords can be "
"specified (method=GET method=HEAD), or multiple methods can be separated by "
"an '\\|' (method=GET\\|HEAD). The method keyword is optional and it is "
"defaulted to ALL. This supports ANY string as the HTTP method, meaning no "
"validation is done to check whether it is a valid HTTP method. This allows "
"you to create filters for any method that your origin may require, this is "
"especially useful if you use newer methods that aren't know to "
"trafficserver (such as PROPFIND) or if your origin uses an http-ish "
"protocol."
