msgid "An option list of whitespace-separated arguments may follow the plugin name. These are passed as an argument vector to the plugin's initialization function, :c:func:`TSPluginInit`. Arguments that begin with the ``$`` character designate |TS| configuration variables. These arguments will be replaced with the value of the corresponding configuration variable before the plugin is loaded.  When using configuration variable expansion, note that most |TS| configuration can be changed. If a plugin requires the current value, it must obtain that using the management API."

msgid "Each configuration line consists of a path to an ``.so`` file. This path can either be absolute, or relative to the plugin directory (usually ``/usr/local/libexec/trafficserver``).  Failure to load a plugin is fatal, and will cause |TS| to abort. In general, it is not possible to know whether it is safe for the service to run without a particular plugin, since plugins can have arbitrary effects on caching and authorization policies."

msgid "The :file:`plugin.config` file controls run-time loadable plugins available to |TS|, as well as their configuration.  Plugins listed in this file are referred to as *global plugins* because they are always loaded and have global effect. This is in contrast to plugins specified in :file:`remap.config`, whose effects are limited to the specific mapping rules to which they are applied."
