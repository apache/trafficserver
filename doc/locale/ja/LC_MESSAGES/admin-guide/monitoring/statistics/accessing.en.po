"provides HTTP access to all |TS| statistcs. The plugin returns a JSON "

"Simply changing the path at which your statistics are available should be "
"considered very weak security. While cache objects themselves cannot be "
"accessed through the plugin's JSON output, and no modifications to the "

"statistics may reveal much more about your network's traffic and "
"architecture than you wish to be publicly available."
