"Due to the speed and efficiency of |TS|, a heavily-loaded node will "
"generate many events and the event logs can quickly grow to very large "
"sizes.  Using SQL-like aggregate operators, you can configure |TS| to "
"create summary log files that summarize a set of log entries over a "
"specified period of time. This can significantly reduce the size of the log "
"files generated."
