"In addition to ``ASCII`` and ``BINARY`` file modes for custom log formats, |"
"TS| can output log entries in ``ASCII_PIPE`` mode. This mode writes the log "
"entries to a UNIX named pipe (a buffer in memory). Other processes may read "
"from this named pipe using standard I/O functions."

"The advantage of this mode is that |TS| does not need to write the entries "
"to disk, which frees disk space and bandwidth for other tasks. When the "
"buffer is full, |TS| drops log entries and issues an error message "
"indicating how many entries were dropped. Because |TS| only writes complete "
"log entries to the pipe, only full records are dropped."
