"By analyzing the log files, you can determine how many people use the |TS| "
"cache, how much information each person requested, what pages are most "
"popular, and so on. |TS| supports several standard log file formats, such "
"as Squid and Netscape, as well as user-defined custom formats. You can "
"analyze the standard format log files with off-the-shelf analysis packages. "
"To help with log file analysis, you can separate log files so they contain "
"information specific to protocol or hosts. You can also configure |TS| to "
"roll log files automatically at specific intervals during the day or when "
"they reach a certain size."
