"You can use the |TS| log file collation feature to collect all logged "
"information in one place. Log collation enables you to analyze a set of |"
"TS| clustered nodes as a whole (rather than as individual nodes) and to use "
"a large disk that might only be located on one of the nodes in the cluster."

"|TS| collates log files by using one or more nodes as log collation servers "
"and all remaining nodes as log collation clients. When a |TS| node "
"generates a buffer of event log entries, it first determines if it is the "
"collation server or a collation client. The collation server node writes "
"all log buffers to its local disk, just as it would if log collation was "
"not enabled.  Log collation servers can be part of a node running |TS|."

"The collation client nodes prepare their log buffers for transfer across "
"the network and send the buffers to the log collation server. When the log "
"collation server receives a log buffer from a client, it writes it to its "
"own log file as if it was generated locally. For a visual representation of "
"this, see the figure below."

"Log collation can have an impact on network performance. Because all nodes "
"are forwarding their log data buffers to the single collation server, a "
"bottleneck can occur. In addition, collated log files contain timestamp "
"information for each entry, but entries in the files do not appear in "
"strict chronological order. You may want to sort collated log files before "
"doing analysis."
