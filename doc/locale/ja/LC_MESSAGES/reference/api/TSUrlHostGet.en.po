"The URL data structure is a parsed version of a standard internet URL. The "
"Traffic Server URL API provides access to URL data stored in marshal "
"buffers. The URL functions can create, copy, retrieve or delete entire "
"URLs, and retrieve or modify parts of URLs, such as their host, port or "
"scheme information."
