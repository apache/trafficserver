"The :type:`TSIOBuffer` data structure is the building block of the TSVConn "
"abstraction. An IO buffer is composed of a list of buffer blocks which are "
"reference counted so that they can reside in multiple buffers at the same "
"time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one IO buffer to "
"another using :func:`TSIOBufferCopy` since Traffic Server only needs to "
"copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately and not actually "
"copy any data; however applications should still strive to ensure data "
"blocks are a reasonable size."

"The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple "
"readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each other, they "
"manipulate IO buffers through the :type:`TSIOBufferReader` data structure. "
"Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no corresponding :type:"
"`TSIOBufferWriter` data structure. The writer simply modifies the IO buffer "
"directly."

":func:`TSIOBufferDestroy` destroys the IO buffer bufp. Since multiple IO "
"buffers can share data, this does not necessarily free all of the data "
"associated with the IO buffer but simply decrements the appropriate "
"reference counts."

":func:`TSIOBufferWrite` appends length bytes from the buffer buf to the IO "
"buffer bufp and returns the number of bytes successfully written into the "
"IO buffer."

":func:`TSIOBufferProduce` makes nbytes of data available for reading in the "
"IO buffer bufp. A common pattern for writing to an IO buffer is to copy "
"data into a buffer block and then call INKIOBufferProduce to make the new "
"data visible to any readers."

"The watermark of an TSIOBuffer is the minimum number of bytes of data that "
"have to be in the buffer before calling back any continuation that has "
"initiated a read operation on this buffer. As a writer feeds data into the "
"TSIOBuffer, no readers are called back until the amount of data reaches the "
"watermark. Setting a watermark can improve performance because it avoids "
"frequent callbacks to read small amounts of data. :func:"
