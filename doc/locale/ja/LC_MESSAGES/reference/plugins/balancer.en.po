"The ``replacement`` URL in the mapping rule is not used. The argument to "

"The ``hash`` balancing policy performs a consistent hash across the set of "
"origins. This minimizes the number of hash entries that must be moved when "
"the set of origin servers changes. An optional list of hash fields follows "
"the ``hash`` keyword. Each specified hash field is hashed to select an "
"outbound origin server."

msgid ""
"The ``balancer`` plugin does not check the health of the origin servers, "
"however the plugin is fully reloadable so health checking is usualy simple "
"to implement. Most production environments already have mechanisms to check "
"service health. It is recommended that you write a simple script to monitor "
"this information and rewrite :file:`remap.config` when appropriate. "
"Running :option:`traffic_line -x` will reload the ``balancer`` plugin with "
"the new set of origin servers."
