"The `XDebug` plugin allows HTTP clients to debug the operation of the "
"Traffic Server cache using the ``X-Debug`` header. The plugin is triggered "
"by the presence of the ``X-Debug`` header in the client request. The "
"contents of this header should be the names of the debug headers that are "
"desired in the response. The `XDebug` plugin will remove the ``X-Debug`` "
"header from the client request and inject the desired headers into the "
"client response."
