"The ``header_filter`` is a simple plugin for filtering out headers from "
"requests (or responses). Typical configuration is done either with a global "

"Even if you don't have a global configuration, if your remap rules schedules"

"Comments are prefixed with ``#``, and in most cases, the regular expression "

"If not specified, the default hook to add the rules (headers to filter) is "
"``READ_REQUEST_HDR``. It's completely acceptable (and useful) to configure a"
" remap rule to delete headers in a later hook (e.g. when reading a response "
"from the server). This is what actually makes the plugin even remotely "
"useful."
