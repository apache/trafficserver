"The :file:`ssl_multicert.config` file lets you configure Traffic Server to "
"use multiple SSL server certificates to terminate the SSL sessions. If you "
"have a Traffic Server system with more than one IP address assigned to it, "
"then you can assign a different SSL certificate to be served when a client "
"requests a particular IP address or host name."

"Traffic Server attempts two certificate selections during SSL connection "

"selection examines the IP address and port that the client is connecting to "
"and chooses the best certificate from the those that have a ``dest_ip`` "
"specification. If no matching certificates are found, a default certificate "
"is chosen.  The final certificate selection is made during the SSL "
"handshake.  At this point, the client may use `Server Name Indication "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_ to request a "
"specific hostname. Traffic Server will use this request to select a "
"certificate with a matching subject or subject alternative name. Failing "
"that, a wildcard certificate match is attempted. If no match can be made, "
