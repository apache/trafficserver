"The :file:`congestion.config` file enables you to configure Traffic Server "
"to stop forwarding HTTP requests to origin servers when they become "
"congested, and then send the client a message to retry the congested origin "
"server later. After you modify the :file:`congestion.config` file, navigate "
"to the Traffic Server bin directory; then run the :option:`traffic_line -x` "
"command to apply changes. When you apply the changes to a node in a cluster,"
" Traffic Server automatically applies the changes to all other nodes in the "
"cluster. Traffic Server uses the :file:`congestion.config` file only if you "
"enable the `Congestion Control <http#UsingCongestionControl>`_ option."
