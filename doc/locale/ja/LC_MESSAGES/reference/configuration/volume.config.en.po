"The :file:`volume.config` file enables you to manage your cache space more "
"efficiently and restrict disk usage by creating cache volumes of different "
"sizes for specific protocols. You can further configure these volumes to "
"store data from certain origin servers and/or domains in the "
":file:`hosting.config` file."

"The volume configuration must be the same on all nodes in a cluster. You "
"must stop Traffic Server before you change the cache volume size and "
"protocol assignment. For step-by-step instructions about partitioning the "
"cache, refer to :ref:`partitioning-the-cache`."

"where ``volume_number`` is a number between 1 and 255 (the maximum number of"
" volumes is 255) and ``protocol_type`` is ``http``. Traffic Server supports "
"``http`` for HTTP volume types; ``volume_size`` is the amount of cache space"
" allocated to the volume. This value can be either a percentage of the total"
" cache space or an absolute value. The absolute value must be a multiple of "
"128 MB, where 128 MB is the smallest value. If you specify a percentage, "
"then the size is rounded down to the closest multiple of 128 MB."

"Each volume is striped across several disks to achieve parallel I/O. For "
"example: if there are four disks, then a 1-GB volume will have 256 MB on "
"each disk (assuming each disk has enough free space available). If you do "
"not allocate all the disk space in the cache, then the extra disk space is "
"not used. You can use the extra space later to create new volumes without "
"deleting and clearing the existing volumes."
