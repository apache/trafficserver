"The :file:`hosting.config` file enables you to assign cache partitions to "

"`Partitioning the Cache <../configuring-cache#PartitoningCache>`_. Before "
"you can assign cache partitions to specific origin servers and/or domains, "
"you must first partition your cache according to size and protocol in the "
