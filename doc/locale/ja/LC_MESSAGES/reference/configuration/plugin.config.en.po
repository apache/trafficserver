"The :file:`plugin.config` file controls run-time loadable plugins available "
"to the Traffic Server, as well as their configuration. Plugins listed in "
"this file are referred to as `global plugins` because they are always "
"loaded and have global effect.  This is in contrast to plugins specified "
"in :file:`remap.config`, whose effects are limited to the specific mapping "
"rules they are applied to."

"Each configuration line consists of a path to an ``.so`` file. This path "
"can either be absolute, or relative to the plugin directory (usually ``/usr/"
"local/libexec/trafficserver``).  Failure to load a plugin is fatal, and "
"will cause Traffic Server to abort. In general, it is not possible to know "
"whether it is safe for the service to run without a particular plugin, "
"since plugins can have arbitrary effects on caching and authorization "
"policies."

"Plugins should only be listed once. The order in which the plugins are "

"An option list of whitespace-separated arguments may follow the plugin "
"name. These are passed as an argument vector to the plugin's initialization "
"function, :c:func:`TSPluginInit`. Arguments that begin with the ``$`` "
"character designate Traffic Server configuration variables. These arguments "
"will be replaced with the value of the corresponding configuration variable "
"before the plugin is loaded. When using configuration variable expansion, "
"note that most Traffic Server configuration can be changed. If a plugin "
"requires the current value, it must obtain that using the management API."
