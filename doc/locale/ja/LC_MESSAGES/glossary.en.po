"A callable object that contains state. These are are mechanism used by "
"Traffic Server to implement callbacks and continued computations. Continued "
"computations are critical to efficient processing of traffic because by "
"avoiding any blocking operations that wait on external events. In any such "
"case a continuation is used so that other processing can continue until the "
"external event occurs. At that point the continuation is invoked to continue"
" the suspended processing. This can be considered similar to co-routines."
