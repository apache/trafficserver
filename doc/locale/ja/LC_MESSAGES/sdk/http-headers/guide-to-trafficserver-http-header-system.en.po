"It's not safe to assume that string data contained in marshal buffers (such "
"as URLs and MIME fields) is stored in null-terminated string copies. "
"Therefore, your plugins should always use the length parameter when "
"retrieving or manipulating these strings. You **cannot** pass in ``NULL`` "
"for string-length return values; string values returned from marshall "
"buffers are not null-terminated. If you need a null-terminated value, then "
"use ``TSstrndup`` to automatically null-terminate a string. The strings "
"that come back and are not null-terminated **cannot** be passed into the "
"common ``str*()`` routines"
