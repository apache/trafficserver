"When you fetch a component object or create a new object, you get back a "
"handle to the object location. The handle is either an ``TSMLoc`` for an "
"object location or ``char *`` for a string location. You can manipulate the "
"object through these handles, but when you are finished you need to release "
"the handle to free up system resources."

"The general guideline is to release all ``TSMLoc`` and string handles you "
"retrieve. The one exception is the string returned by ``TSUrlStringGet``, "
"which must be freed by a call to ``TSfree``."

"The handle release functions expect three arguments: the marshal buffer "
"containing the data, the location of the parent object, and the location of "
"the object to be released. The parent location is usually clear from the "
"creation of the ``TSMLoc`` or string. For example, if your plugin had the "
"following calls:"
