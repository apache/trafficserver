"When using Traffic Server, you cannot create a new MIME field without an "
"associated MIME header or HTTP header; MIME fields are always seen as part "
"of a MIME header or HTTP header."

"To use a MIME field, you must specify the MIME header or HTTP header to "
"which it belongs - this is called the field's **parent header**. The "
"``TSMimeField*`` functions in older versions of the SDK have been "
"deprecated, as they do not require the parent header as inputs. The current "
"version of Traffic Server uses new functions, the **``TSMimeHdrField``** "
"series, which require you to specify the location of the parent header "
"along with the location of the MIME field. For every deprecated "
"*``TSMimeField``* function, there is a new, preferred ``TSMimeHdrField*`` "
"function. Therefore, you should use the **``TSMimeHdrField``** functions "
"instead of the deprecated *``TSMimeField``* series. Examples are provided "
"below."
