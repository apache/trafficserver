"MIME headers can contain more than one MIME field with the same name. "
"Earlier versions of Traffic Server joined multiple fields with the same "
"name into one field with composite values. This behavior came at a "
"performance cost and caused interoperability problems with older clients "
"and servers. Therefore, this version of Traffic Server does not coalesce "
"duplicate fields."

"Properly-behaving plugins should check for the presence of duplicate fields "
"and then iterate over the duplicate fields via :c:func:"
