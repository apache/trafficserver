"MIME headers can contain more than one MIME field with the same name. "
"Earlier versions of Traffic Server joined multiple fields with the same name"
" into one field with composite values. This behavior came at a performance "
"cost and caused interoperability problems with older clients and servers. "
"Therefore, this version of Traffic Server does not coalesce duplicate "
"fields."
