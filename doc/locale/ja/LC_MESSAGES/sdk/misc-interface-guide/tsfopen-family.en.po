"The ``fopen`` family of functions in C is normally used for reading "
"configuration files, since ``fgets`` is an easy way to parse files on a "
"line-by-line basis. The ``TSfopen`` family of functions aims at solving the "
"same problem of buffered IO and line at a time IO in a platform-independent "
"manner. The ``fopen`` family of C library functions can only open a file if "
"a file descriptor less than 256 is available. Since Traffic Server often has"
" more than 2000 file descriptors open at once, however, the likelihood of an"
" available file descriptor less than 256 very small. To solve this problem, "
"the ``TSfopen`` family can open files with descriptors greater than 256."

"The ``TSfopen`` family of routines is not intended for high speed IO or "
"flexibility - they are blocking APIs (not asynchronous). For performance "
"reasons, you should not directly use these APIs on a Traffic Server thread "
"(when being called back on an HTTP hook); it is better to use a separate "
"thread for doing the blocking IO. The ``TSfopen`` family is intended for "
"reading and writing configuration information when corresponding usage of "
"the ``fopen`` family of functions is inappropriate due to file descriptor "
"and portability limitations. The ``TSfopen`` family of functions consists of"
" the following:"
