"The Traffic Server API thread functions enable you to create, destroy, and "
"identify threads within Traffic Server. Multithreading enables a single "
"program to have more than one stream of execution and to process more than "
"one transaction at a time. Threads serialize their access to shared "
"resources and data using the ``TSMutex`` type, as described in `Mutexes <../"
"mutex-guide/#Mutexes>`__."
