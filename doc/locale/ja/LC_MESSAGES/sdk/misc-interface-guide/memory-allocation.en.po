"Traffic Server provides five routines for allocating and freeing memory. "
"These routines correspond to similar routines in the C library. For "
"example, ``TSrealloc`` behaves like the C library routine ``realloc``."

"There are two main reasons for using the routines provided by Traffic "
"Server. The first is portability: the Traffic Server API routines behave "
"the same on all of Traffic Server's supported platforms. For example, "
"``realloc`` does not accept an argument of ``NULL`` on some platforms. The "
"second reason is that the Traffic Server routines actually track the memory "
"allocations by file and line number. This tracking is very efficient, "
"always turned on, and quite useful when tracking down memory leaks."
