"The ``TSConfig`` family of functions is designed to provide a fast and "
"efficient mechanism for accessing and changing global configuration "
"information within a plugin. Such a mechanism is simple enough to provide "
"in a single-threaded program, but the translation to a multi-threaded "
"program such as Traffic Server is difficult. A common technique is to have "
"a single mutex protect the global configuration information; however, the "
"problem with this solution is that a single mutex becomes a performance "
"bottleneck very quickly."

"The ``TSConfig`` family of functions define an interface to storing and "
"retrieving an opaque data pointer. Internally, Traffic Server maintains "
"reference count information about the data pointer so that a call to "
"``TSConfigSet`` will not disturb another thread using the current data "
"pointer. The philosophy is that once a user has a hold of the configuration "
"pointer, it is okay for it to be used even if the configuration changes; "
"all that a user typically wants is a non-changing snapshot of the "
"configuration. You should use ``TSConfigSet`` for all global data updates."
