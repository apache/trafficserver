"To use a vconnection, a user must first get a handle to one. This is usually"
" accomplished by having it handed to the user; the user may also simply "
"issue a call that creates a vconnection (such as ``TSNetConnect)``. In the "
"case of transform plugins, the plugin creates a transformation vconnection "
"viav ``TSTransformCreate`` and then accesses the output vconnection using "
"``TSTransformOutputVConnGet``."

"After getting a handle to a vconnection, the user can then issue a read or "
"write call. It's important to note that not all vconnections support both "
"reading and writing - as of yet, there has not been a need to query a "
"vconnection about whether it can perform a read or write operation. That "
"ability should be obvious from context."

"To issue a read or write operation, a user calls ``TSVConnRead`` or "
"``TSVConnWrite``. These two operations both return ``VIO (TSVIO)``. The VIO "
"describes the operation being performed and how much progress has been made."
" Transform plugins initiate output to the downstream vconnection by calling "
"``TSVConnWrite``."

"A vconnection read or write operation is different from a normal UNIX "
"``read(2)`` or ``write(2)`` operation. Specifically, the vconnection "
"operation can specify more data to be read or written than exists in the "
"buffer handed to the operation. For example, it's typical to issue a read "
"for ``INT64_MAX`` (9 quintillion) bytes from a network vconnection in order "
"to read all the data from the network connection until the end of stream is "
"reached. This contrasts with the usual UNIX fashion of issuing repeated "
"calls to ``read(2)`` until one of the calls finally returns ``0`` to "
"indicate the end of stream was reached (indeed, the underlying "
"implementation of vconnections on UNIX still does issue those calls to "
"``read(2)``, but the interface does not expose that detail)."

"At most, a given vconnection can have one read operation and one write "
"operation being performed on it. This is restricted both by design and "
"common sense: if two write operations were performed on a single "
"vconnection, then the user would not be able to specify which should occur "
"first and the output would occur in an intermingled fashion. Note that both "
"a read operation and a write operation can happen on a single vconnection at"
" the same time; the restriction is for more than one operation of the same "
"type."

"One obvious issue is that the buffer passed to ``TSVConnRead`` and "
"``TSVConnWrite`` won't be large enough - there is no reasonable way to make "
"a buffer that can hold ``INT64_MAX`` (9 quintillion) bytes! The secret is "
"that vconnections engage in a protocol whereby they signal to the user (via "
"the continuation passed to ``TSVConnRead`` and ``TSVConnWrite``) that they "
"have emptied the buffers passed to them and are ready for more data. When "
"this occurs, it is up to the user to add more data to the buffers (or wait "
"for more data to be added) and then wake up the vconnection by calling "
"``TSVIOReenable`` on the VIO describing the operation. ``TSVIOReenable`` "
"specifies that the buffer for the operation has been modified and that the "
"vconnection should reexamine it to see if it can make further progress."

"Sometimes it's desirable to simply close down the write portion of a "

" the ``TSVConnShutdown`` function, which shuts down either the read or write"
" portion of a vconnection. *Shutdown* means that the vconnection will no "

" was shut down. For example: if the user shuts down the write portion of a "
"connection, then the ``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_READY`` or "
"``TS_EVENT_VCONN_WRITE_COMPLETE`` events will not be produced. In the null "
"transform plugin, the write operation is shut down with a call to "
