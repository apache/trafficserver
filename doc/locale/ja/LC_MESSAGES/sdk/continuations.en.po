"The continuation interface is Traffic Server's basic callback mechanism. "
"**Continuations** are instances of the opaque data type ``TSCont``. In its "
"basic form, a continuation represents a handler function and a mutex."

"A reentrant call occurs when the continuation passed as an argument to the "

"that ``contp``'s handler will be called directly and then ``TSCacheRead`` "
"returns."

"The above example first assumes that the continuation is called back with "
"``event1``; it then does the first reentrant call that schedules the "
"continuation to receive ``event2``. Because the call is reentrant, the "
"processor calls back the continuation right away with ``event2`` and the "
"continuation is destroyed. If you try to access the continuation or one of "
"its members after the reentrant call, then you might access something that "
"has been deallocated. To avoid accessing something that has been "
"deallocated, never access the continuation or any of its members after a "
"reentrant call - just exit the handler."

"**Note:** Most HTTP transaction plugin continuations do not need non-null "
"mutexes because they're called within the processing of an HTTP "
"transaction, and therefore have the transaction's mutex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sdk/continuations.en.rst:114
msgid ""
"It is also possible to specify a continuation's mutex as ``NULL``. This "
"should be done only when registering a continuation to a global hook, by a "
"call to ``TSHttpHookAdd``. In this case, the continuation can be called "
"simultaneously by different instances of HTTP SM running on different "
"threads. Having a mutex here would slow and/or hinder Traffic Server "
"performance, since all the threads will try to lock the same mutex. The "
"drawback of not having a mutex is that such a continuation cannot have data "
"associated with it (i.e., ``TSContDataGet/Set`` cannot be used)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sdk/continuations.en.rst:124
msgid ""
"When using a ``NULL`` mutex it is dangerous to access the continuation's "
"data, but usually continuations with ``NULL`` mutexes have no data "
"associated with them anyway. An example of such a continuation is one that "
"gets called back every time an HTTP request is read, and then determines "
"from the request alone if the request should go through or be rejected. An "
"HTTP transaction gives its continuation data to the ``contp``."

"Before being activated, a caller must grab the continuation's mutex. This "
"requirement makes it possible for a continuation's handler function to "
"safely access its data and to prevent multiple callers from running it at "
"the same time (see the :ref:`about-the-sample-protocol` for usage). The "
"data protected by the mutex is any global or continuation data associated "
"to the continuation by ``TSContDataSet``. This does not include the local "
"data created by the continuation handler function. A typical example of "
"continuations created with associated data structures and mutexes is the "
"transaction state machine created in the sample Protocol plugin (see :ref:"
"`one-way-to-implement-a-transaction-state-machine`)."

"the reentrant call passes itself as a continuation to the reentrant API. In "
"this case, the continuation should not try to access its data after calling "
"the reentrant API. The reason for this is that data may be modified by the "
"section of code in the continuation's handler that handles the event sent "
"by the API. It is recommended that you always return after a reentrant call "
"to avoid accessing something that has been deallocated."
