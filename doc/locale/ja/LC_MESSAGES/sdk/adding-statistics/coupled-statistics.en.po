"As a very simple example, suppose you have three statistics: ``sum``, "
"``part_1``, and ``part_2``. They must always preserve the relationship that "
"``sum = part_1  + part_2``. If you update ``part_1`` without updating "
"``sum`` at the same time, then the equation becomes untrue. Therefore, the "
"statistics are said to be *coupled*."

"The mechanism for updating coupled statistics jointly is to create local "
"copies of global coupled statistics in the routines that modifiy them. When "
"each local copy is updated appropriately, do a global update using "
"``TSStatsCoupledUpdate``. To specify which statistics are related to one "
"another, establish a coupled statistic category and make sure that each "
"coupled statistic belongs to the appropriate category. When it is time to do"
" the global update, specify the category to be updated."
