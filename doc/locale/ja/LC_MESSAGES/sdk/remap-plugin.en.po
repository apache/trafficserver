"The Remap plugin provides a more flexible, dynamic way of specifying remap "
"rules. It is not built on top of the Traffic Server APIs and exists solely "
"for the purpose of URL remapping. The remap plugin is not global --it is "
"configured on a per-remap rule basis, which enables you to customize how "
"URLs are redirected based on individual rules in the ``remap.config`` file."

"The Traffic Server Remap API enables a plugin to dynamically map a client "
"request to a target URL. Each plugin is associated with one or more remap "
"rules in ``remap.config`` (an \"instance\"). If a request URL matches a "
"remap rule's \"fromURL\", then Traffic Server calls the plugin-defined "
"remap function for that request."
