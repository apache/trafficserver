"A **mutex** is the basic synchronization method used within Traffic Server "
"to protect data from simultaneous access by multiple threads. A mutex acts "

"The Traffic Server API provides two functions that attempt to access and "
"lock the data: ``InkMutexLockTry`` and ``TSMutexLock``. **``TSMutexLock``** "
"is a blocking call - if you use it, you can slow Traffic Server performance "
"because transaction processing pauses until the mutex is unlocked. It "
"should be used only on threads created by the plugin "
"``TSContThreadCreate``. Never use it on a continuation handler called back "
"by the Cache, Net, or Event Processor. Even if the critical section is very "
"small, do not use it. If you need to update a flag, then set a variable and/"
"or use atomic operations. If ``TSMutexLock`` is used in any case other than "
"the one recommended above, then the result will be a serious performance "
"impact."

"**``TSMutexLockTry``**, on the other hand, attempts to lock the mutex only "
"if it is unlocked (i.e., not being used by another thread). It should be "

"the ``TSMutexLockTry`` attempt fails, then you can schedule a future "
"attempt (which must be at least 10 milliseconds later)."

"You do not need to use locks when a continuation has registered itself to "
"be called back by HTTP hooks and it only uses the HTTP APIs. In the example "
"above, the continuation ``txn_contp`` has registered itself to be called "
"back at HTTP hooks and it only uses the HTTP APIs. In this case only, it's "
"safe to access data shared between ``txnp`` and ``txn_contp`` without "
"grabbing a lock. In the example above, ``txn_contp`` is created with a "
"``NULL`` mutex. This works because the HTTP transaction ``txnp`` is the "
"only one that will call back ``txn_contp``, and you are guaranteed that "
"``txn_contp`` will be called back only one hook at a time. After processing "
"is finished, ``txn_contp`` will reenable ``txnp``."

"In all other cases, you should create a mutex with the continuation. In "
"general, a lock is needed when you're using iocore APIs or any other API "
"where ``txn_contp`` is scheduled to be called back by a processor (such as "
"the cache processor, the DNS processor, etc.). This ensures that "
"``txn_contp`` is called back sequentially and not simultaneously. In other "
"words, you need to ensure that ``txn_contp`` will not be called back by "
"both ``txnp`` and the cache processor at the same time, since this will "
"result in a situation wherein you're executing two pieces of code in "
"conflict."
