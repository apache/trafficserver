"A **mutex** is the basic synchronization method used within Traffic Server "

"The Traffic Server API provides two functions that attempt to access and "
"lock the data: ``InkMutexLockTry`` and ``TSMutexLock``. **``TSMutexLock``** "
"is a blocking call - if you use it, you can slow Traffic Server performance "
"because transaction processing pauses until the mutex is unlocked. It should"
" be used only on threads created by the plugin ``TSContThreadCreate``. Never"
" use it on a continuation handler called back by the Cache, Net, or Event "
"Processor. Even if the critical section is very small, do not use it. If you"
" need to update a flag, then set a variable and/or use atomic operations. If"
" ``TSMutexLock`` is used in any case other than the one recommended above, "
"then the result will be a serious performance impact."

"**``TSMutexLockTry``**, on the other hand, attempts to lock the mutex only "

"You do not need to use locks when a continuation has registered itself to be"

"safe to access data shared between ``txnp`` and ``txn_contp`` without "
"grabbing a lock. In the example above, ``txn_contp`` is created with a "
"``NULL`` mutex. This works because the HTTP transaction ``txnp`` is the only"
" one that will call back ``txn_contp``, and you are guaranteed that "

"the cache processor, the DNS processor, etc.). This ensures that "
"``txn_contp`` is called back sequentially and not simultaneously. In other "
"words, you need to ensure that ``txn_contp`` will not be called back by both"
" ``txnp`` and the cache processor at the same time, since this will result "
