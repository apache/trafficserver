"The cache API enables plugins to read, write, and remove objects in the "
"Traffic Server cache. All cache APIs are keyed by an object called an "
"``TSCacheKey``; cache keys are created via ``TSCacheKeyCreate``; keys are "
"destroyed via ``TSCacheKeyDestroy``. Use ``TSCacheKeyDigestSet`` to set the "
"hash of the cache key."

"Note that the cache APIs differentiate between HTTP data and plugin data. "
"The cache APIs do not allow you to write HTTP docs in the cache; you can "
"only write plugin-specific data (a specific type of data that differs from "
"the HTTP type)."

"``TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ`` - indicates the lookup was successful. The "

"``TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ_FAILED`` - indicates the lookup was "
"unsuccessful. Reasons for this event could be that another continuation is "
"writing to that cache location, or the cache key doesn't refer to a cached "
"resource. Data payload for this event indicates the possible reason the "
"read failed (``TSCacheError``)."
