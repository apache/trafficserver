"The cache API enables plugins to read, write, and remove objects in the "
"Traffic Server cache. All cache APIs are keyed by an object called an "
"``TSCacheKey``; cache keys are created via ``TSCacheKeyCreate``; keys are "
"destroyed via ``TSCacheKeyDestroy``. Use ``TSCacheKeyDigestSet`` to set the "
"hash of the cache key."

"Note that the cache APIs differentiate between HTTP data and plugin data. "
"The cache APIs do not allow you to write HTTP docs in the cache; you can "
"only write plugin-specific data (a specific type of data that differs from "
"the HTTP type)."
