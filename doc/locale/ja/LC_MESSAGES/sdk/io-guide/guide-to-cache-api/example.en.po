"In the example below, suppose there is a cache hit and the cache returns a "
"vconnection that enables you to read the document from cache. To do this, "
"you need to prepare a buffer (``cache_bufp``) to hold the document; "
"meanwhile, use ``TSVConnCachedObjectSizeGet`` to find out the actual size "
"of the document (``content_length``). Then, issue ``TSVConnRead`` to read "
"the document with the total data length required as ``content_length``. "
