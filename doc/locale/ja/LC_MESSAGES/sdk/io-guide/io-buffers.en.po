"The IO buffer data structure is the building block of the vconnection "
"abstraction. An **IO buffer** (``TSIOBuffer``) is composed of a list of "
"buffer blocks that point to buffer data. Both the buffer block "
"(``TSIOBufferBlock``) and buffer data (``TSIOBufferData``) data structures "
"are reference-counted, so they can reside in multiple buffers at the same "
"time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one IO buffer to "
"another via ``TSIOBufferCopy``, since Traffic Server must only copy "
"pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately (and doesn't actually "
"copy any data)."

"The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple "
"readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each other, they "
"manipulate IO buffers through the ``TSIOBufferReader`` data structure. "
"Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no corresponding "
"``TSIOBufferWriter`` data structure. The writer simply modifies the IO "
"buffer directly. To see an example that illustrates how to use IOBuffers, "
"refer to the sample code in the description of "
"```TSIOBufferBlockReadStart`` <http://people.apache.org/~amc/ats/doc/html/"
"ts_8h.html#a367203e6e2cf4349e019952782deb96c>`__."

"The ``TSIOBufferReader`` data structure tracks how much data in "
"``TSIOBuffer`` has been read. It has an offset number of bytes that is the "
"current start point of a particular buffer reader (for every read operation "
"on an ``TSIOBuffer``, you must allocate an ``TSIOBufferReader``)."
