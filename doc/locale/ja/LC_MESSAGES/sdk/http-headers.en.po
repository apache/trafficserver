"The diagram also shows that an HTTP header contains pointers to the URL "
"location and the MIME header location. You can obtain the URL location from "
"an HTTP header using the function ``TSHttpHdrUrlGet``. To work with MIME "
"headers, you can pass either a MIME header location or an HTTP header "
"location to MIME header functions . If you pass an HTTP header to a MIME "
"header function, then the system locates the associated MIME header and "
"executes the MIME header function on the MIME header location."
