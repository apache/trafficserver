"The sample basic authorization plugin, ``basic-auth.c``, checks for basic "
"HTTP proxy authorization. In HTTP basic proxy authorization, client user "
"names and passwords are contained in the ``Proxy-Authorization`` header. The"
" password is encoded using base64 encoding. The plugin checks all incoming "
"requests for the authorization header, user name, and password. If the "
"plugin does not find all of the these, then it reenables with an error "
"(effectively stopping the transaction) and adds a transaction hook to the "
"send response header event."
