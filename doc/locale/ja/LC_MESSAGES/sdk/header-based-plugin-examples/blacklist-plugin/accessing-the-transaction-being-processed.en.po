"The key here is that if the event is an HTTP transaction event, then the "
"data passed to the continuation's handler is of type ``TSHttpTxn`` (a data "
"type that represents HTTP transactions). Your plugin can then do things "
"with the transaction. Here's how it looks in the code for the Blacklist "
"plugin's handler:"

"In general, the return value of the handler function is not used. The "
"continuation argument is the continuation being called back, the event is "
"the event being sent to the continuation, and the data pointed to by ``void "
"*edata`` depends on the type of event. The data types for each event type "
"are listed in :doc:`Writing Handler Functions <../../continuations/writing-"
"handler-functions.en>`"
