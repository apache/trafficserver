"The Blacklist plugin sends \"access forbidden\" messages to clients if "
"their requests are directed to blacklisted hosts. Therefore, the plugin "
"needs a transaction hook so it will be called back when Traffic Server's "
"HTTP state machine reaches the \"send response header\" event. In the "
"Blacklist plugin's ``handle_dns`` routine, the transaction hook is added as "
"follows:"

"This code fragment shows some interesting features. The plugin is comparing "
"the requested site to the list of blacklisted sites. While the plugin is "
"using the blacklist, it must acquire the mutex lock for the blacklist to "
"prevent configuration changes in the middle of a blacklisting operation. If "
"the requested site is blacklisted, then the following things happen:"

"A transaction hook is added with ``TSHttpTxnHookAdd``; the plugin is called "
"back at the \"send response header\" event (i.e., the plugin sends an "
"Access forbidden message to the client). You can see that in order to add a "
"transaction hook, you need a handle to the transaction being processed."

"The transaction is reenabled using ``TSHttpTxnReenable`` with "
"``TS_EVENT_HTTP_ERROR`` as its event argument. Reenabling with an error "
"event tells the HTTP state machine to stop the transaction and jump to the "
"\"send response header\" state. Notice that if the requested site is not "
"blacklisted, then the transaction is reenabled with the "
"``TS_EVENT_HTTP_CONTINUE`` event."

"In general, whenever the plugin is doing something to a transaction, it "
"must reenable the transaction when it is finished. In other words: every "
"time your handler function handles a transaction event, it must call "
"``TSHttpTxnReenable`` when it is finished. Similarly, after your plugin "
"handles session events (``TS_EVENT_HTTP_SSN_START`` and "
"``TS_EVENT_HTTP_SSN_CLOSE``), it must reenable the session with "
"``TSHttpSsnReenable``. Reenabling the transaction twice in the same plugin "
"routine is a bad error."
