msgid ""
"The sample blacklisting plugin included in the Traffic Server SDK is "
"``blacklist-1.c``. This plugin checks every incoming HTTP client request "
"against a list of blacklisted web sites. If the client requests a "
"blacklisted site, then the plugin returns an ``Access forbidden`` message "
"to the client."

msgid ""
"You create the static parent continuation in the mandatory ``TSPluginInit`` "
"function. This parent continuation effectively **is** the plugin: the "
"plugin executes only when this continuation receives an event from Traffic "
"Server. Traffic Server passes the event as an argument to the "
"continuation's handler function. When you create continuations, you must "
"create and specify their handler functions."

#: ../../sdk/header-based-plugin-examples/blacklist-plugin.en.rst:45
msgid ""
"You can specify an optional mutex lock when you create continuations. The "
"mutex lock protects data shared by asynchronous processes. Because Traffic "
"Server has a multi-threaded design, race conditions can occur if several "
"threads try to access the same continuation's data."

msgid ""
"The handler function for the plugin is ``blacklist_plugin``, and the mutex "
"is null. The continuation handler function's job is to handle the events "
"that are sent to it; accordingly, the ``blacklist_plugin`` routine consists "
"of a switch statement that covers each of the events that might be sent to "
"it:"

msgid ""
"The flow of HTTP processing with the blacklist plugin is illustrated in the "
"figure titled :ref:`BlackListPlugin`. This example also contains a simple "
"configuration management interface. It can read a list of blacklisted sites "
"from a file (``blacklist.txt``) that can be updated by a Traffic Server "
"administrator. When the configuration file is updated, Traffic Server sends "
"an event to the plugin that wakes it up to do some work."

msgid ""
"When you write handler functions, you have to anticipate any events that "
"might be sent to the handler by hooks or by other functions. In the "
"Blacklist plugin, ``TS_EVENT_OS_DNS`` is sent because of the global hook "
"established in ``TSPluginInit``, ``TS_EVENT_HTTP_SEND_RESPONSE_HDR`` is "
"sent because the plugin contains a transaction hook (see :doc:`blacklist-"
"plugin/setting-up-a-transaction-hook.en`). It is good practice to have a "
"default case in your switch statements."
