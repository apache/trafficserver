"If you're new to writing Traffic Server plugins, then read `Getting Started "
"<../getting-started>`_ and `Creating Traffic Server Plugins <../how-to-"
"create-trafficserver-plugins>`_, and use the remaining chapters as needed. "
"`Header-Based Plugin Examples <../header-based-plugin-examples>`_ provides "
"details about plugins that work on HTTP headers, while `HTTP Transformation "
"Plugins <../http-transformation-plugin>`_ explains how to write a plugin "
"that transforms or scans the body of an HTTP response. `New Protocol Plugins"
" <../new-protocol-plugins>`_ provides essential information if you want to "
"support your own protocol on Traffic Server."
