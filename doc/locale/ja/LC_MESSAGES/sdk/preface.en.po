"The *Traffic Server Software Developer's Kit* is a reference for creating "
"plugins. **Plugins** are programs that add services (such as filtering or "
"content transformation) or entire features (such as new protocol support) to"
" Traffic Server. If you are new to writing Traffic Server plugins, then read"
" the first two chapters, :ref:`sdk-getting-started` and :ref:`how-to-create-"
"to-create-trafficserver-plugins`, and use the remaining chapters as needed. "
":ref:`header-based-plugin-examples` provides details about plugins that work"
" on HTTP headers, while :ref:`http-transformation-plugin` explains how to "
"write a plugin that transforms or scans the body of an HTTP response. If you"
" want to support your own protocol on Traffic Server, then reference :ref"
":`new-protocol-plugins`."
