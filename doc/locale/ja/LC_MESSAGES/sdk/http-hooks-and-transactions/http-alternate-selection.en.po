"The HTTP alternate selection functions provide a mechanism for hooking into "
"Traffic Server's alternate selection mechanism and augmenting it with "
"additional information. **HTTP alternate selection** refers to the process "
"of choosing between several alternate versions of a document for a specific "
"URL. Alternates arise because the HTTP 1.1 specification allows different "
"documents to be sent back for the same URL (depending on the clients "
"request). For example, a server might send back a GIF image to a client that"
" only accepts GIF images, and might send back a JPEG image to a client that "
"only accepts JPEG images."

"The alternate selection mechanism is invoked when Traffic Server looks up a "
"URL in its cache. For each URL, Traffic Server stores a vector of "
"alternates. For each alternate in this vector, Traffic Server computes a "
"quality value between 0 and 1 that represents how \"good\" the alternate is."
" A quality value of 0 means that the alternate is unacceptable; a value of 1"
" means that the alternate is a perfect match."

"If a plugin hooks onto the ``TS_HTTP_SELECT_ALT_HOOK``, then it will be "
"called back when Traffic Server performs alternate selection. You cannot "
"register locally to the hook ``TS_HTTP_SELECT_ALT_HOOK`` by using "
"``TSHttpTxnHookAdd`` - you can only do so by using only ``TSHttpHookAdd``. "
"Since Traffic Server does not actually have an HTTP transaction or an HTTP "
"session on hand when alternate selection is performed, it is only valid to "
"hook onto the global list of ``TS_HTTP_SELECT_ALT_HOOK``. Traffic Server "
"calls each of the select alternate hooks with the "
"``TS_EVENT_HTTP_SELECT_ALT`` event. The ``void *edata`` argument that is "
"passed to the continuation is a pointer to an ``TSHttpAltInfo`` structure. "
"It can be used later to call the HTTP alternate selection functions listed "
"at the end of this section. Unlike other hooks, this alternate selection "
"callout is non-blocking; the expectation is that the quality value for the "
"alternate will be changed by a call to ``TSHttpAltInfoQualitySet``."

"A common usage for the alternate selection mechanism is when a plugin "
"transforms a document for some clients and not for others, but wants to "
"store both the transformed and unchanged document. The client's request will"
" specify whether it accepted the transformed document. The plugin will then "
"determine if the alternate matches this specification and then set the "
"appropriate quality level for the alternate."
