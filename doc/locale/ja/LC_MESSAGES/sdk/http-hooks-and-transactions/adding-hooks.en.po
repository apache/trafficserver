"**Global HTTP hooks** HTTP transaction hooks are set on a global basis using"

"as the parameter to ``TSHttpHookAdd`` is called for every transaction. "
"``TSHttpHookAdd`` must be used in ``TSPluginInit``."

" a specific HTTP transaction. You cannot add transaction hooks in "

"**Session hooks** An HTTP session starts when a client opens a connection to"
" Traffic Server and ends when the connection closes. A session can consist "
"of several transactions. Session hooks enable you to hook your plugin to a "
"particular point in every transaction within a specified session (see `HTTP "
"Sessions <HTTPSessions.html>`__). Session hooks are added in a manner "
"similar to transaction hooks (ie, you first need a handle to an HTTP "
"session)."
