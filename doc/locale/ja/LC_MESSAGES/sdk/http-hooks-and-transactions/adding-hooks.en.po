"**Global HTTP hooks** HTTP transaction hooks are set on a global basis "
"using the function ``TSHttpHookAdd``. This means that the continuation "
"specified as the parameter to ``TSHttpHookAdd`` is called for every "
"transaction. ``TSHttpHookAdd`` must be used in ``TSPluginInit``."

"**Transaction hooks** Transaction hooks can be used to call plugins back "
"for a specific HTTP transaction. You cannot add transaction hooks in "
"``TSPluginInit``; you first need a handle to a transaction. See `Accessing "
"the Transaction Being Processed <../header-based-plugin-examples/blacklist-"

"**Session hooks** An HTTP session starts when a client opens a connection "
"to Traffic Server and ends when the connection closes. A session can "
"consist of several transactions. Session hooks enable you to hook your "
"plugin to a particular point in every transaction within a specified "
"session (see `HTTP Sessions <HTTPSessions.html>`__). Session hooks are "
"added in a manner similar to transaction hooks (ie, you first need a handle "
"to an HTTP session)."

"**HTTP select alternate hook** Alternate selection hooks enable you to hook "
"on to the alternate selection state. These hooks must be added globally, "

"<HTTPAlternateSelection.html>`__ for information on the alternate selection "
