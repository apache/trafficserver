"Hooks are points in Traffic Server transaction processing where plugins can "
"step in and do some work. Registering a plugin function for callback amounts"
" to \"adding\" the function to a hook. You can register your plugin to be "

"A **transaction** consists of a single HTTP request from a client and the "
"response Traffic Server sends to that client. Thus, a transaction begins "
"when Traffic Server receives a request and ends when Traffic Server sends "
"the response."

"Traffic Server uses **HTTP state machines** to process transactions. The "
"state machines follow a complex set of states involved in sophisticated "
"caching and document retrieval (taking into account, for example, alternate "
"selection, freshness criteria, and hierarchical caching). The Traffic Server"
" API provides hooks to a subset of these states, as illustrated in the `HTTP"
" Transaction State Diagram <#HHTTPTxStateDiag>`__ below."
