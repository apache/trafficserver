"Hooks are points in Traffic Server transaction processing where plugins can "
"step in and do some work. Registering a plugin function for callback "
"amounts to \"adding\" the function to a hook. You can register your plugin "
"to be called back for every single transaction or only for specific "
"transactions."

"A **transaction** consists of a single HTTP request from a client and the "
"response Traffic Server sends to that client. Thus, a transaction begins "
"when Traffic Server receives a request and ends when Traffic Server sends "
"the response."

"A **session** consists of a single client connection to Traffic Server; it "
"may consist of a single transaction or several transactions in succession. "
"The session starts when the client connection opens and ends when the "
"connection closes."

"Traffic Server uses **HTTP state machines** to process transactions. The "
"state machines follow a complex set of states involved in sophisticated "
"caching and document retrieval (taking into account, for example, alternate "
"selection, freshness criteria, and hierarchical caching). The Traffic "
"Server API provides hooks to a subset of these states, as illustrated in "
"the :ref:`http-txn-state-diagram` below."

"The two **transform hooks**, ``TS_HTTP_REQUEST_TRANSFORM_HOOK`` and "

"the \"set up transform\" ovals in the :ref:`http-txn-state-diagram` below."
