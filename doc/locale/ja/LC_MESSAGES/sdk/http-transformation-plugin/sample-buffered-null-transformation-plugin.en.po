"The buffered null transform, ``bnull-transform.c``, reads the response "
"content into a buffer and then writes the full buffer out to the client. "
"Many examples of transformations, such as compression, require you to "
"gather the full response content in order to perform the transformation."

"The default behavior for transformations is to cache the transformed "
"content (if desired, you also can tell Traffic Server to cache "
"untransformed content). Therefore, only responses received directly from an "
"origin server need to be transformed. Objects served from the cache are "
"already transformed. To determine whether the response is from the origin "
"server, the routine transformable checks the response header for the \"200 "
"OK\" server response."

"The ``bnull_transform`` function has to handle ``ERROR``, "

"The ``handle_transform`` function examines the data parameter for the "
