"The Traffic Server cache consists of a high-speed object database called "
"the **object store**. The object store indexes objects according to URLs "
"and associated headers. This enables Traffic Server to store, retrieve, and "
"serve not only web pages, but also parts of web pages - which provides "
"optimum bandwidth savings. Using sophisticated object management, the "
"object store can cache alternate versions of the same object (versions may "
"differ because of dissimilar language or encoding types). It can also "
"efficiently store very small and very large documents, thereby minimizing "
"wasted space. When the cache is full, Traffic Server removes stale data to "
"ensure the most requested objects are kept readily available and fresh."
