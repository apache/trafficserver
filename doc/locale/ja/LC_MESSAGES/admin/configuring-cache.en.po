"The Traffic Server cache consists of a high-speed object database called the"
" **object store**. The object store indexes objects according to URLs and "
"associated headers. This enables Traffic Server to store, retrieve, and "
"serve not only web pages, but also parts of web pages - which provides "
"optimum bandwidth savings. Using sophisticated object management, the object"
" store can cache alternate versions of the same object (versions may differ "
"because of dissimilar language or encoding types). It can also efficiently "
"store very small and very large documents, thereby minimizing wasted space. "
"When the cache is full, Traffic Server removes stale data to ensure the most"
" requested objects are kept readily available and fresh."
