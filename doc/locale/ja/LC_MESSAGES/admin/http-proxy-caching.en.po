"Internet users direct their requests to web servers all over the Internet. A"
" caching server must act as a **web proxy server** so it can serve those "
"requests. After a web proxy server receives requests for web objects, it "
"either serves the requests or forwards them to the **origin server** (the "
"web server that contains the original copy of the requested information). "
"The Traffic Server proxy supports **explicit proxy caching**, in which the "
"user's client software must be configured to send requests directly to the "
"Traffic Server proxy. The following overview illustrates how Traffic Server "
