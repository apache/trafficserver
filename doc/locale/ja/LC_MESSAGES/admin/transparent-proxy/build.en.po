"Enable TPROXY support, which is the Linux kernel feature used for "
"transparency. This should be present in the base installation, there is no "
"package associated with it. \\* ``auto`` Do automatic checks for the the "
"TPROXY header file (``linux/in.h``) and enable TPROXY support if the "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT`` definition is present. This is the default if this option"
" is not specified or ``value`` is omitted. \\* ``no`` Do not check for "
"TPROXY support, disable support for it. \\* ``force`` Do not check for "
"TPROXY support, enable it using the $ats@ built in value for "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT``. This is useful for systems that have it in the kernel "
"for but some reason do not have the appropriate system header file. \\* "
"*number* Do not check for TPROXY support, use *number* as the "
"``IP_TRANSPARENT`` value. There are, at present, no known standard "
"distributions of Linux that support TPROXY but use a value different from "
"the built in ATS default. However, a custom built kernel may do so and in "
"that case the specific value can be specified."

"In the default case, ATS configuration will automatically check for TPROXY "
"support via the presence of the ``linux/in.h`` header file and compile in "
"TPROXY support if it is available. If that fails, you may be able to recover"
" by using one of the options above. Note that transparency may be built in "
"by default but it is not active unless explicitly enabled in the ATS "
"configuration files."
