"The green arrows are packets originating from the client and the red arrows "
"are packets originating from the origin server. All traffic not directed to "
"the local address will pass through the bridge. We need to break into some "
"of the traffic and subject it to routing so that it can be routed to ATS. "
"This requires ``ebtables``. The flows we want to intercept are green 1 (from"
" client to bridge) and red 1 (origin server to bridge)."

"In this example we will intercept port 80 (HTTP) traffic. We will use the "
"``BROUTING`` chain because it is traversed only for packets that originated "
"externally and arrived on a (forwarding enabled) interface. Although it "
"looks like this will intercept all port 80 traffic it will only affect the "
"two flows described above. ``-j redirect`` marks the packet as being "
"diverted to the bridge and not forwarded, and the ``DROP`` target puts the "
"packets in the normal ``iptables`` routing so that we can use standard "
"device tests on them [1]_(#1). Although this example handles only port 80, "
"other ports are the same except for the port value. Note also the port here "
"is the port from the point of view of the clients and origin servers, not "

"At this point the directionality of the interfaces matters. For the example "
"``eth1`` is the inbound (client side) interface, while ``eth0`` is the "
"outbound (origin server side) interface. We mark both flows of packets so "
"that we can use policy routing on them. For inbound packets we need to use "
"``TPROXY`` to force acceptance of packets to foreign IP addresses. For "
"returning outbound packets there will be a socket open bound to the foreign "
"address, we need only force it to be delivered locally. The value for "
"``--on-ip`` is 0 because the target port is listening and not bound to a "
"specific address. The value for ``--on-port`` must match the Traffic Server "
"server port. Otherwise its value is arbitrary. ``--dport`` and ``--sport`` "
