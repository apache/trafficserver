"The basic concept for a shared interface is to use a tunnel to simulate the "
"dedicated interface case. This enables the packets to be distinguished at "

"WCCP configuration cannot distinguish between packets returning from the "
"origin server and packets returning from Traffic Server as they are "
"distinguished only by layer 2 addressing [3]_(#3). Fortunately the GRE "
"tunnel used for packet forwarding and return can be used as the simulated "
