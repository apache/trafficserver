"That means, if it's reachable on the internet, you have configured an *Open "
"Proxy*. Most of the time, this is *not* what you want, so you'll have to "
"make sure it's either only reachable within your NAT or is secured by "
"firewall rules that permit only those clients to access it which you want to"
" it to access."
