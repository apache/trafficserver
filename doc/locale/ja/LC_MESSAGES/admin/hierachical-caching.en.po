"A cache hierarchy consists of cache levels that communicate with each "
"other. Traffic Server supports several types of cache hierarchies. All "
"cache hierarchies recognize the concept of *parent* and *child*. A parent "

"parent."

"If a Traffic Server node cannot find a requested object in its cache, then "

"unavailable, the other parent caches will be checked in turn until either "
"the request is serviced properly or no further parent caches are available "

"The figure below illustrates a simple cache hierarchy with a Traffic Server "

"hierarchy (because it's configured to forward missed requests to a parent "
"cache). The request is a cache miss, so Traffic Server then forwards the "
"request to the parent cache where it is a cache hit. The parent sends a "
"copy of the content to the Traffic Server, where it is cached and then "
"served to the client. Future requests for this content can now be served "
