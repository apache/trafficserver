"A cache hierarchy consists of cache levels that communicate with each "
"other. Traffic Server supports several types of cache hierarchies. All "
"cache hierarchies recognize the concept of *parent* and *child*. A parent "
"cache is a cache higher up in the hierarchy, to which Traffic Server can "
"forward requests. A child cache is a cache for which Traffic Server is a "
"parent."

"If a Traffic Server node cannot find a requested object in its cache, then "
"it searches a parent cache (which itself can search other caches) before "
"finally retrieving the object from the origin server. You can configure a "
"Traffic Server node to use multiple parent caches so that if one parent is "
"unavailable, the other parent caches will be checked in turn until either "
"the request is serviced properly or no further parent caches are available "
"and the origin server is contacted. This is called `Parent Failover`_. "

"The figure below illustrates a simple cache hierarchy with a Traffic Server "
"node configured to use a parent cache. In the following scenario, a client "
"sends a request to a Traffic Server node that is a child in the cache "
"hierarchy (because it's configured to forward missed requests to a parent "
"cache). The request is a cache miss, so Traffic Server then forwards the "
"request to the parent cache where it is a cache hit. The parent sends a "
"copy of the content to the Traffic Server, where it is cached and then "
"served to the client. Future requests for this content can now be served "
"directly from the Traffic Server cache (until the data is stale or expired)."

"If the request is a cache miss on the parent, then the parent retrieves the "
