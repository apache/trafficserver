"A Traffic Server cluster consists of multiple Traffic Server nodes. The "
"nodes in a cluster share configuration information and can form a single "
"logical cache. Traffic Server detects the addition and deletion of nodes in "
"the cluster automatically and can detect when a node is unavailable. Traffic"
" Server uses its own protocol for clustering, which is multicast for node "
"location and heartbeat, but unicast for all data exchange within the "
"cluster. Traffic Server has two clustering modes:"

"In management-only clustering mode, Traffic Server cluster nodes share "
"configuration information. You can administer all the nodes at the same "
"time. Traffic Server uses a multicast management protocol to provide a "
"single system image of your Traffic Server cluster. Information about "
"cluster membership, configuration, and exceptions is shared across all "
"nodes, and the :program:`traffic_manager` process automatically propagates "
"configuration changes to all the nodes."

msgid ""
"In full-clustering mode, as well as sharing configuration information, a "
"Traffic Server cluster distributes its cache across its nodes into a single,"
" virtual object store, rather than replicating the cache node by node. "
"Traffic Server can provide an enormous aggregate cache size and can maximize"
" cache hit rate by storing objects only once across the entire cluster."

"A fully clustered Traffic Server maps objects to specific nodes in the "
"cluster. When a node receives a request, it checks to see if the request is "
"a hit somewhere in the cluster. If the request is a hit on a different node,"
" the node handling the request obtains the object from the hit node and "
"serves it to the client. Traffic Server uses its own communication protocol "
"to obtain an object from sibling cluster nodes."
