"There must be a gateway device through which passes all network traffic from"
" the client to the Internet (or external cloud). The gateway is responsible "
"for effectively splicing ATS in to selected streams of that traffic. Each "
"traffic stream is split in to two, with ATS terminating both sides. That is,"
" stream green-1, red-2, is split in to the green connection and the red "
"connection. Note that ATS may or may not be on the gateway system, the "
"redirected traffic can flow over other network infrastructure."

"Because ATS uses two connections transparency can be set independently on "
"the client and origin server (Internet / external cloud) side. We will "
"define what is generally called \"transparent proxy\" as two aspects, "
"*inbound transparency* and *outbound transparency*."

"Inbound transparency is a proxy that is transparent to connections that are "
"inbound to the proxy, i.e. a connection initiated by a client which connects"
" to the proxy (green-1). Similarly, outbound transparency is a proxy that is"
" transparent to connections that are outbound from the proxy, i.e. a "
"connection initiated by the proxy to an origin server (red-2)."

"In most treatments these two types of transparency are treated as unitarily "

"It is critical to note that any transparency requires specialized routing "
