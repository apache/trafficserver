"Each layer (except the bottom) uses this API and also provides it. This "

"Transparent operations would benefit from the *Preloaded* resolver. This "
"would be loaded with the origin host address provided by the client "
"connection. This could be done early in processing and then no more logic "
"would be required to skip DNS processing as it would happen without "
"additional action by the state machine. It would handle the problem of de "
"facto denial of service if an origin server becomes unavailable in that "
"configuration, as *Preloaded* would switch to alternate addresses "
"automatically."

"Adding host file access would be easier as well, as it could be done in a "

"arrangement rather yet more configuration knobs."

"The biggest hurdle is being able to unwind a resolver chain when a block is "
"encountered. There are some ways to deal with this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../arch/proposals/hostdb.en.rst:145
msgid ""
"1) Set a maximum resolver chain length and declare the request instance so "
"that there is storage for state for that many resolvers. If needed and "
"additional value of maximum storage per chain could be set as well. The "
"expected number of elements in a chain is expected to be limited, 10 would "
"likely be a reaosnable limit. If settable at source configuration time this "
"should be sufficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../arch/proposals/hostdb.en.rst:150
msgid ""
"2) Embed class allocators in resolver chains and mark the top / outermost / "
"first resolver. The maximum state size for a resolution can be calculated "
"when the chain is created and then the top level resolver can use an "
"allocation pool to efficiently allocate request objects. This has an "
"advantage that with a wrapper class the request object can be passed along "
"cheaply. Whether that's an advantage in practice is unclear."

"If plugins can provide resolvers, how can these can integrated in to "

msgid "Feedback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../arch/proposals/hostdb.en.rst:164
msgid ""
"It should be possible for a client to provide feedback about addresses (e."
"g., the origin server at this address is not available). Not all resolvers "
"will handle feedback but some will and that must be possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../arch/proposals/hostdb.en.rst:167
msgid ""
"Related to this is that caching resolvers (such as *AddressCache*) must be "
"able to iterator over all resolved addresses even if their client does not "
"ask for them. In effect they must background fill the address data."
