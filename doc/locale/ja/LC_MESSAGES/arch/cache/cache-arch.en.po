"Evacuation data structures are defined by dividing up the volume content in "

"for each evacuation region. Each element is a doubly linked list of "
":cpp:class:`EvacuationBlock` instances. Each instance contains a "
":cpp:class:`Dir` that specifies the fragment to evacuate. It is assumed that"
" an evacuation block is placed in the evacuation bucket (array element) that"

" is handled during evacuation). Objects are evacuated by specifying the "
"first or earliest fragment in the evactuation block. The evactuation "
"operation will then continue the evacuation for subsequent fragments in the "
