"In order to improve performance, :program:`traffic_server` caches commonly "
"used data structures in a set of free object lists. This option disables "
"these caches, causing :program:`traffic_server` to use :manpage:`malloc(3)` "
"for every allocation. Though this option should not commonly be needed, it "
"may be beneficial in memory-constrained environments or where the working "
"set is highly variable."
