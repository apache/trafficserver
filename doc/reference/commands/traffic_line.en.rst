Synopsis

:program:`traffic_line` [options]

.. _traffic-line-commands:

Description
===========

:program:`traffic_line` is used to execute individual Traffic Server
commands and to script multiple commands in a shell.

Options
=======

.. program:: traffic_line

.. option:: -B, --bounce_cluster

    Bounce all Traffic Server nodes in the cluster. Bouncing Traffic
    Server shuts down and immediately restarts Traffic Server,
    node-by-node.

.. option:: -b, --bounce_local

    Bounce Traffic Server on the local node. Bouncing Traffic Server
    shuts down and immediately restarts the Traffic Server node.

.. option:: -C, --clear_cluster

    Clears accumulated statistics on all nodes in the cluster.

.. option:: -c, --clear_node

    Clears accumulated statistics on the local node.

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print usage information and exit.

.. option:: -L, --restart_local

    Restart the :program:`traffic_manager` and :program:`traffic_server`
    processes on the local node.

.. option:: -M, --restart_cluster

    Restart the :program:`traffic_manager` process and the
    :program:`traffic_server` process on all the nodes in a cluster.

.. option:: -m REGEX, --match_var REGEX

    Display the current values of all performance statistics or configuration
    variables whose names match the given regular expression.

.. option:: -r VAR, --read_var VAR

    Display specific performance statistics or a current configuration
    setting.

.. option:: -s VAR, --set_var VAR

    Set the configuration variable named *VAR*. The value of the configuration
    variable is given by the :option:`traffic_line -v` option.
    Refer to the :file:`records.config` documentation for a list
    of the configuration variables you can specify.

.. option:: -S, --shutdown

    Shut down Traffic Server on the local node.

.. option:: -U, --startup

    Start Traffic Server on the local node.

.. option:: -v VALUE, --value VALUE

    Specify the value to set when setting a configuration variable.

.. option:: -V, --version

    Print version information and exit.

.. option:: -x, --reread_config

    Initiate a Traffic Server configuration file reread. Use this
    command to update the running configuration after any configuration
    file modification.

.. option:: -Z, --zero_cluster

    Reset performance statistics to zero across the cluster.

.. option:: -z, --zero_node

    Reset performance statistics to zero on the local node.

.. option:: --offline PATH

   Mark a cache storage device as offline. The storage is identified by a *path* which must match exactly a path
   specified in :file:`storage.config`. This removes the storage from the cache and redirects requests that would have
   used this storage to other storage. This has exactly the same effect as a disk failure for that storage. This does
   not persist across restarts of the :program:`traffic_server` process.

.. option:: --alarms

   List all alarm events that have not been acknowledged (cleared).

.. option:: --clear_alarms [all | #event | name]

   Clear (acknowledge) an alarm event. The arguments are "all" for all current
   alarms, a specific alarm number (e.g. ''1''), or an alarm string identifier
   (e.g. ''MGMT_ALARM_PROXY_CONFIG_ERROR'').

.. option:: --status

   Show the current proxy server status, indicating if we're running or not.

.. option:: --decode_via VAR

   Decode Via Header and provide detailed explaination of the fields. The value of Via header is given by variable VAR.
   Via header can be given within [] or without []

.. _traffic-line-performance-statistics:

Performance Statistics
======================

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_other_errors
  Total number of *other* ssl client connection errors (counts ssl
  errors that are not captured in other user agent stats below)

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_expired_cert
  Total number of ssl client connection failures where the cert was
  expired.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_revoked_cert
  Total number of ssl client connection failures where the cert was
  revoked.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_unknown_cert
  Total number of ssl client connection failures related to the cert,
  but specific error was unknown.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_cert_verify_failed
  Total number of ssl client connection failures where cert verification
  failed.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_bad_cert
  Total number of ssl client connection failures where the cert is bad.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_decryption_failed
  Total number of ssl client connection decryption failures (during
  negotiation).

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_wrong_version
  Total number of ssl client connections that provided an invalid protocol
  version.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_unknown_ca
  Total number of ssl client connection that failed due to unknown ca.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_other_errors
  Total number of *other* ssl origin server connection errors (counts ssl
  errors that are not captured in other origin server stats below).

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_expired_cert
  Total number of ssl origin server connection failures where the cert
  was expired.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_revoked_cert
  Total number of ssl origin server connection failures where the cert
  was revoked.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_unknown_cert
  Total number of ssl origin server connection failures related to the
  cert where specific error was unknown.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_cert_verify_failed
  Total number of ssl origin server connection failures where cert
  verification failed.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_bad_cert
  Total number of ssl origin server connection failures where the cert
  is bad.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_decryption_failed
  Total number of ssl origin server connection decryption failures
  (during negotiation).

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_wrong_version
  Total number of ssl origin server connections that provided an invalid
  protocol version.

proxy.process.ssl.origin_server_unknown_ca
  Total number of ssl origin server connection that failed due to
  unknown ca.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_sessions
  Total number of ssl/tls sessions created.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_session_hit
  Total number of session hits.  A previous session was reused which
  resulted in an abbreviated ssl client negotiation.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_session_miss
  Total number of session misses.  The ssl client provided a session id
  that was not found in cache and, therefore, could not be used.

proxy.process.ssl.user_agent_session_timeout
  Total number of session timeouts.  The ssl client provided a session, but
  it could not be used because it was past the session timeout.

proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.{CIPHERNAME}
  Total number of ssl client connections that used cipherName.  The
  list of cipher statistics is dynamic and depends upon the installed
  ciphers and the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.server.cipher_suite`
  configuration. The set of cipher statistics can be discovered
  with :option:`traffic_line -m`. For example::

    $ traffic_line -m proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.
    proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 0
    proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 0
    proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384 0
    proxy.process.ssl.cipher.user_agent.ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384 0
    ...

Examples
========

Configure Traffic Server to log in Squid format::

    $ traffic_line -s proxy.config.log.squid_log_enabled -v 1
    $ traffic_line -s proxy.config.log.squid_log_is_ascii -v 1
    $ traffic_line -x
