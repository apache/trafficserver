TSVConnFdCreate
===============

Create a TSVConn from a socket.

Synopsis
--------

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. c:function:: TSVConn TSVConnFdCreate(int fd)

Description
-----------

:func:`TSVConnFdCreate` accepts a network socket and returns a new
:type:`TSVConn` constructed from the socket. The socket descriptor
must be an already connected socket. It will be placed into
non-blocking mode.

Return Values
-------------

On success, the returned TSVConn object owns the socket and the
caller must not close it.  If :func:`TSVConnFdCreate` fails, :data:`NULL`
is returned, the socket is unchanged and the caller must close
it.

Examples
--------

The example below is excerpted from `example/intercept/intercept.cc`
in the Traffic Server source distribution. It demonstrates how to
use :func:`TSVConnFdCreate` to construct a :type:`TSVConn` from a
connected socket.
