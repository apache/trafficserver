Description
===========

The :type:`TSIOBuffer` data structure is the building block of the TSVConn
abstraction. An IO buffer is composed of a list of buffer blocks which
are reference counted so that they can reside in multiple buffers at the
same time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one IO
buffer to another using :func:`TSIOBufferCopy` since Traffic Server only needs to
copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately and not actually
copy any data; however applications should still strive to ensure data
blocks are a reasonable size.

The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple
readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each
other, they manipulate IO buffers through the :type:`TSIOBufferReader`
data structure. Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no
corresponding :type:`TSIOBufferWriter` data structure. The writer
simply modifies the IO buffer directly.

:func:`TSIOBufferCreate` creates an empty :type:`TSIOBuffer`.

:func:`TSIOBufferSizedCreate` creates an empty :type:`TSIOBuffer`
with an initial capacity of index bytes.

:func:`TSIOBufferDestroy` destroys the IO buffer bufp. Since multiple IO
buffers can share data, this does not necessarily free all of the data
associated with the IO buffer but simply decrements the appropriate reference counts.

:func:`TSIOBufferWrite` appends length bytes from the buffer buf to the IO
buffer bufp and returns the number of bytes successfully written into the
IO buffer.

:func:`TSIOBufferProduce` makes nbytes of data available for reading in the IO
buffer bufp. A common pattern for writing to an IO buffer is to copy
data into a buffer block and then call INKIOBufferProduce to make the new
data visible to any readers.

The watermark of an TSIOBuffer is the minimum number of bytes of data
that have to be in the buffer before calling back any continuation that
has initiated a read operation on this buffer. As a writer feeds data
into the TSIOBuffer, no readers are called back until the amount of data
reaches the watermark. Setting a watermark can improve performance
because it avoids frequent callbacks to read small amounts of data.
:func:`TSIOBufferWaterMarkGet` gets the current watermark for the IO buffer
bufp.

:func:`TSIOBufferWaterMarkSet` gets the current watermark for the IO buffer
bufp to water_mark bytes.
