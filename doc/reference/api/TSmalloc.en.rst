Traffic Server memory allocation API.

Synopsis
========

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. function:: void * TSmalloc(size_t size , const char * path)
.. function:: void * TSrealloc(void * ptr , size_t size , const char * path)
.. function:: char * TSstrdup(const char * str)
.. function:: char * TSstrndup(const char * str, size_t size)
.. function:: size_t TSstrlcpy(char * dst , const char * src , size_t size)
.. function:: size_t TSstrlcat(char * dst , const char * src , size_t size)
.. function:: void TSfree(void * ptr)

Description
===========

Traffic Server provides a number of routines for allocating and freeing
memory. These routines correspond to similar routines in the C library.
For example, :func:`TSrealloc` behaves like the C library routine :func:`realloc`.
There are two reasons to use the routines provided by Traffic Server. The
first is portability. The Traffic Server API routines behave the same on
all of Traffic Servers supported platforms. For example, :func:`realloc` does
not accept an argument of :data:`NULL` on some platforms. The second reason is
that the Traffic Server routines actually track the memory allocations by
file and line number. This tracking is very efficient, is always turned
on, and is useful for tracking down memory leaks.

:func:`TSmalloc` returns a pointer to size bytes of memory allocated from the
heap. Traffic Server uses :func:`TSmalloc` internally for memory allocations.
Always use :func:`TSfree` to release memory allocated by :func:`TSmalloc`; do not use
:func:`free`.

:func:`TSstrdup` returns a pointer to a new string that is a duplicate
of the string pointed to by str. The memory for the new string is
allocated using :func:`TSmalloc` and should be freed by a call to
:func:`TSfree`.  :func:`TSstrndup` returns a pointer to a new string that
is a duplicate of the string pointed to by str and size bytes
long. The new string will be NUL-terminated. This API is very
useful for transforming non NUL-terminated string values returned
by APIs such as :func:`TSMimeHdrFieldValueStringGet` into NUL-terminated
string values. The memory for the new string is allocated using
:func:`TSmalloc` and should be freed by a call to :func:`TSfree`.

:func:`TSstrlcpy` copies up to size - 1 characters from the NUL-terminated
string src to dst, NUL-terminating the result.

:func:`TSstrlcat` appends the NUL-terminated string src to the end of dst. It
will append at most size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-terminating the
result.

:func:`TSfree` releases the memory allocated by :func:`TSmalloc` or :func:`TSrealloc`. If
ptr is :data:`NULL`, :func:`TSfree` does no operation.
