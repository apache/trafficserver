TSMimeHdrFieldAppend
====================

Returns the :c:type:`TSMLoc` location of a specified MIME field from
within the MIME header located at hdr.


Synopsis
--------

`#include <ts/ts.h>`

.. c:function:: TSReturnCode TSMimeHdrFieldAppend(TSMBuffer bufp, TSMLoc hdr, TSMLoc field)


Description
-----------

The retrieved_str parameter specifies which field to retrieve.  For
each MIME field in the MIME header, a pointer comparison is done
between the field name and retrieved_str.  This is a much quicker
retrieval function than :c:func:`TSMimeHdrFieldFind` since it obviates
the need for a string comparison.  However, retrieved_str must be one
of the predefined field names of the form :c:data:`TS_MIME_FIELD_XXX`
for the call to succeed.  Release the returned :c:type:`TSMLoc` handle
with a call to :c:func:`TSHandleMLocRelease`.
