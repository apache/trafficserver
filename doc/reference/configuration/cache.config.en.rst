.. configfile:: cache.config

============
cache.config
============

The :file:`cache.config` file (by default, located in 
``/opt/trafficserver/etc/trafficserver/``) defines how Traffic Server caches 
web objects. You can add caching rules to specify the following: 

    - Not to cache objects from specific IP addresses 
    - How long to pin particular objects in the cache
    - How long to consider cached objects as fresh 
    - Whether to ignore no-cache directives from the server
    
.. important::

   After you modify the :file:`cache.config` file, navigate to
   the Traffic Server bin directory; then run the :option:`traffic_line -x`
   command to apply changes. When you apply the changes to a node in a
   cluster, Traffic Server automatically applies the changes to all other
   nodes in the cluster.

Format
======

Each line in the :file:`cache.config` file contains a caching rule. Traffic
Server recognizes three space-delimited tags::

   primary_destination=value secondary_specifier=value action=value

You can use more than one secondary specifier in a rule. However, you
cannot repeat a secondary specifier. The following list shows the
possible primary destinations with allowed values.

.. _cache-config-format-dest-domain:

``dest_domain``
   A requested domain name. Traffic Server matches the domain name of
   the destination from the URL in the request.

.. _cache-config-format-dest-host:

``dest_host``
   A requested hostname. Traffic Server matches the hostname of the
   destination from the URL in the request.

.. _cache-config-format-dest-ip:

``dest_ip``
   A requested IP address. Traffic Server matches the IP address of the
   destination in the request.

.. _cache-config-format-url-regex:

``url_regex``
   A regular expression (regex) to be found in a URL.

The secondary specifiers are optional in the :file:`cache.config` file. The
following list shows possible secondary specifiers with allowed values.

.. _cache-config-format-port:

``port``
   A requested URL port.

.. _cache-config-format-scheme:

``scheme``
   A request URL protocol: http or https.

.. _cache-config-format-prefix:

``prefix``
   A prefix in the path part of a URL.

.. _cache-config-format-suffix:

``suffix``
   A file suffix in the URL.

.. _cache-config-format-method:

``method``
   A request URL method: get, put, post, trace.

.. _cache-config-format-time:

``time``
   A time range, such as 08:00-14:00.

.. _cache-config-format-src-ip:

``src_ip``
   A client IP address.

The following list shows possible actions and their allowed values.


.. _cache-config-format-action:

``action``
   One of the following values:

   -  ``never-cache`` configures Traffic Server to never cache
      specified objects.
   -  ``ignore-no-cache`` configures Traffic Server to ignore all
      ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` headers.
   -  ``ignore-client-no-cache`` configures Traffic Server to ignore
      ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` headers from client requests.
   -  ``ignore-server-no-cache`` configures Traffic Server to ignore
      ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` headers from origin server responses.
   -  ``cluster-cache-local`` configures the cluster cache to allow for
      this content to be stored locally on every cluster node.

.. _cache-responses-to-cookies:

``cache-responses-to-cookies``
   Change the style of caching with regard to cookies. This effectively
   overrides the configuration parameter
   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.cache.cache_responses_to_cookies`
   and uses the same values with the same semantics. The override happens
   only for requests that match.
    

.. _cache-config-format-pin-in-cache:

``pin-in-cache``
   Preserves objects in cache, preventing them from being overwritten.
   Does not affect objects that are determined not to be cacheable. This
   setting can have performance issues, and  severely affect the cache. 
   For instance, if the primary destination matches all objects, once the 
   cache is full, no new objects could get written as nothing would be 
   evicted.  Similarly, for each cache-miss, each object would incur extra 
   checks to determine if the object it would replace could be overwritten. 

   The value is the amount of time you want to keep the object(s) in the cache. The
   following time formats are allowed:

   -  ``d`` for days; for example: 2d
   -  ``h`` for hours; for example: 10h
   -  ``m`` for minutes; for example: 5m
   -  ``s`` for seconds; for example: 20s
   -  mixed units; for example: 1h15m20s

.. _cache-config-format-revalidate:

``revalidate``
   For objects that are in cache, overrides the the amount of time the object(s) 
   are to be considered fresh. Use the same time formats as ``pin-in-cache``.

.. _cache-config-format-ttl-in-cache:

``ttl-in-cache``
   Forces object(s) to become cached, as if they had a Cache-Control: max-age:<time>
   header. Can be overruled by requests with cookies. The value is the amount of 
   time object(s) are to be kept in the cache, regardless of Cache-Control response 
   headers. Use the same time formats as pin-in-cache and revalidate.

Examples
========

The following example configures Traffic Server to revalidate ``gif``
and ``jpeg`` objects in the domain ``mydomain.com`` every 6 hours, and
all other objects in ``mydomain.com`` every hour. The rules are applied
in the order listed. ::

   dest_domain=mydomain.com suffix=gif revalidate=6h
   dest_domain=mydomain.com suffix=jpeg revalidate=6h
   dest_domain=mydomain.com revalidate=1h

Force a specific regex to be in cache between 7-11pm of the server's time for 26hours. ::

   url_regex=example.com/articles/popular.* time=19:00-23:00 ttl-in-cache=1d2h

Prevent objects from being evicted from cache: 

   url_regex=example.com/game/.* pin-in-cache=1h
