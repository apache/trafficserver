This plugin gzips or deflates responses, whichever is applicable. It can
compress origin respones as well as cached responses. The plugin is built
and installed as part of the normal Apache Traffic Server installation
process.

Installation
============

Add the following line to :file:`plugin.config`::

    gzip.so

In this case, the plugin will use the default behaviour:

-  Enable caching
-  Compress text/\* for every origin
-  Don't hide accept encoding from origin servers (for an offloading
   reverse proxy)
-  No urls are disallowed from compression

Configuration
=============

Alternatively, a configuration can also be specified::

    gzip.so <path-to-plugin>/sample.gzip.config

After modifying plugin.cofnig, restart traffic server (sudo
traffic_line -L) the configuration is re-read when a management update
is given (sudo traffic_line -x)

Options
=======

Flags and options are:

``enabled``: (``true`` or ``false``) Enable or disable compression for a
host.

``remove-accept-encoding``: (``true`` or ``false``) Sets whether the
plugin should hide the accept encoding from origin servers:

-  To ease the load on the origins.
-  For when the proxy parses responses, and the resulting
   compression/decompression is wasteful.

``cache``: (``true`` or ``false``) When set, the plugin stores the
uncompressed and compressed response as alternates.

``compressible-content-type``: Wildcard pattern for matching
compressible content types.

``disallow``: Wildcard pattern for disabling compression on urls.

Options can be set globally or on a per-site basis, as such::

    # Set some global options first
    cache true
    enabled true
    remove-accept-encoding false
    compressible-content-type text/*

    # Now set a configuration for www.example.com
    [www.example.com]
    cache false
    remove-accept-encoding true
    disallow /notthis/*.js

See example.gzip.config for example configurations.
