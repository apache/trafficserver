Overview
========

One of the key features of Apache Traffic Server is modularity.
Features that aren't needed in the core simply aren't there. This
is a good thing, because it guarantees that our core can remain
fast by concentrating on the things that we always provide: Caching
and proxying.

All other things can be moved into plugins, by opening up a consistent
C API, everyone can implement their own functionality, without
having to touch the core.

Stable plugins
==============

Plugins that are considered stable are installed by default in
Apache Traffic Server releases.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  cacheurl.en
  conf_remap.en
  gzip.en
  header_filter.en
  regex_remap.en
  stats_over_http.en

Experimental plugins
====================

Plugins that are considered experimental are located in the
`plugins/experimental <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=tree;f=plugins/experimental;hb=HEAD>`_
directory of the Apache Traffic Server source tree. Exmperimental plugins can be compiled by passing the
`--enable-experimental-plugins` option to `configure`::

    $ autoconf -i
    $ ./configure --enable-experimental-plugins
    $ make
