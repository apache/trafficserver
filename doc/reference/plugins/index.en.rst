Overview
========

One of the key features of Apache Traffic Server is modularity.
Features that aren't needed in the core simply aren't there. This
is a good thing, because it guarantees that our core can remain
fast by concentrating on the things that we always provide: Caching
and proxying.

All other things can be moved into plugins, by opening up a consistent
C API, everyone can implement their own functionality, without
having to touch the core.

Stable plugins
==============

Plugins that are considered stable are installed by default in
Apache Traffic Server releases.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  CacheURL Plugin: allows you to change the key that is used for caching a request by using any portion of the url via regex <cacheurl.en>
  conf_remap Plugin: allows you to override configuration directives dependent on actual remapping rules <conf_remap.en>
  gzip / deflate Plugin: gzips or deflates responses <gzip.en>
  Header Rewrite Plugin: allows you to modify various headers based on defined rules (operations) on a request or response <header_rewrite.en>
  Regex Remap Plugin: allows you to configure mapping rules based on regular expressions <regex_remap.en>
  Stats over HTTP Plugin: implements an HTTP interface to all Traffic Server statistics <stats_over_http.en>
  TCPInfo Plugin: logs TCP metrics at various points in the HTTP processing pipeline <tcpinfo.en>

Experimental plugins
====================

Plugins that are considered experimental are located in the
`plugins/experimental <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=tree;f=plugins/experimental;hb=HEAD>`_
directory of the Apache Traffic Server source tree. Exmperimental plugins can be compiled by passing the
`--enable-experimental-plugins` option to `configure`::

    $ autoconf -i
    $ ./configure --enable-experimental-plugins
    $ make
