# The latest 4.x sphinx release, currently 4.0.2, fails `make html`.  For
# details, see: https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/issues/7938
#
# The 3.x releases build fine, however. So we currently pin to that.
#
# Once that issue, either with sphinx or our docs, is resolved, then we should
# unpin sphinx by setting the following to "*".
sphinx = "==3.*"

sphinx-rtd-theme = "*"
sphinxcontrib-plantuml = "*"
# i18n
sphinx-intl = "*"

# For parsing Doxygen XML output, to add links from an API description
# to the source code for that object
lxml = "*"
