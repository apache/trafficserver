The append-transform plugin appends text to the body of an HTTP
response. It obtains this text from a file; the name of the file
containing the append text is a parameter you specify in
``plugin.config``, as follows:

::

    append-transform.so path/to/file

The append-transform plugin is based on ``null-transform.c``. The only
difference is that after the plugin feeds the document through the
transformation, it adds text to the response.

Below is a list of the functions in ``append-transform.c``, in the order
they appear in the source code. Below each entry is a description of
what the function does:

-  **``my_data_alloc``**

   Allocates and initializes a ``MyData`` structure. The plugin defines
   a struct, ``MyData``, as follows:

   .. code-block:: c

       typedef struct {
           TSVIO output_vio;
           TSIOBuffer output_buffer;
           TSIOBufferReader output_reader;
           int append_needed;
       } MyData;

   The ``MyData`` structure is used to represent data that the
   transformation (vconnection) needs. The transformation's data pointer
   is set to a ``MyData`` pointer using ``TSContDataSet`` in the
   ``handle_transform`` routine.

-  **``my_data_destroy``**

   Destroys objects of type ``MyData``. To deallocate the transform's
   data, the ``append_transform`` routine (see below) calls
   ``my_data_destroy`` when the transformation is complete.

-  **``handle_transform``**

   This function does the actual data transformation. The transformation
   is created in ``transform_add`` (see below). ``handle_transform`` is
   called by ``append_transform``.

-  **``append_transform``**

   This is the handler function for the transformation vconnection
   created in ``transform_add``. It is the implementation of the
   vconnection.

   -  If the transformation vconnection has been closed, then
      ``append_transform`` calls ``my_data_destroy`` to destroy the
      vonnection.

   -  If ``append_transform`` receives an error event, then it calls
      back the continuation to let it know it has completed the write
      operation.

   -  If it receives a ``WRITE_COMPLETE`` event, then it shuts down the
      write portion of its vconnection.

   -  If it receives a ``WRITE_READY`` or any other event (such as
      ``TS_HTTP_RESPONSE_TRANSFORM_HOOK``), then it calls
      ``handle_transform`` to attempt to transform more data.

-  **``transformable``**

   The plugin transforms only documents that have a content type of
   ``text/html``. This function examines the ``Content-Type`` MIME
   header field in the response header. If the value of the MIME field
   is ``text/html``, then the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns
   zero.

-  **``transform_add``**

   Creates the transformation for the current transaction and sets up a
   transformation hook. The handler function for the transformation is
   ``append_transform``.

-  **``transform_plugin``**

   This is the handler function for the main continuation for the
   plugin. Traffic Server calls this function whenever it reads an HTTP
   response header. ``transform_plugin`` does the following:

   -  Gets a handle to the HTTP transaction being processed

   -  Calls ``transformable`` to determine whether the response document
      content is of type ``text/html``

   -  If the content is transformable, then it calls ``transform_add``
      to create the transformation.

   -  Calls ``TSHttpTxnReenable`` to continue the transaction

-  **``load``**

   Opens the file containing the text to be appended and loads the
   contents of the file into an ``TSIOBuffer`` called ``append_buffer``.

-  **``TSPluginInit``**

   Does the following:

   -  Checks to make sure that the required configuration information
      (the append text filename) is entered in ``plugin.config``
      correctly.

   -  If there is a filename, then ``TSPluginInit`` calls load to load
      the text.

   -  Creates a continuation for the plugin. The handler for this
      continuation is ``transform_plugin``.

   -  Adds the plugin's continuation to
      ``TS_HTTP_READ_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK``. In other words, it sets up a
      callback of the plugin's continuation when Traffic Server reads
      HTTP response headers.
