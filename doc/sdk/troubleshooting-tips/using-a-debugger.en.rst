A debugger can set breakpoints in a plugin. Use a Traffic Server debug
build and compile the plugin with the ``-g`` option. A debugger can also
be used to analyze a core dump. To generate core, set the size limit of
the core files in the :file:`records.config` file to -1 as follows:

::

    CONFIG proxy.config.core_limit INT -1

This is the equivalent of setting ``ulimit -c unlimited``

Debugging Tips:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use a Traffic Server debug version.

-  Use assertions in your plugin (``TSAssert``/``TSReleaseAssert``).
