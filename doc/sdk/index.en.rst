**Abstract**

The *Traffic Server Software Developers Kit* shows you how to create
plugins using the Traffic Server SDK.

Introduction
--------------

This documentation is a work in progress. It was originally written for
a previous, commercially-available version of Traffic Server that
supported different operating systems and more functions than the
current version. As a result, some of the sections may refer to
functionality that no longer exists.

If you find any such issues, you may want to submit a `bug or a
patch <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=12310963>`__.
We also have a Wiki page explaining how to `create useful bug reports
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Filing+useful+bug+reports>`__.
We encourage everyone to file tickets, early and often. Looking for existing,
duplicate bugs is encouraged, but not required.
