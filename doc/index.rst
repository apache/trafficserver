Apache Traffic Server™ speeds Internet access, enhances website
performance, and delivers unprecedented web hosting capabilities.

What Is Apache Traffic Server?
==============================

Traffic Server is a high-performance web proxy cache that improves
network efficiency and performance by caching frequently-accessed
information at the edge of the network. This brings content physically
closer to end users, while enabling faster delivery and reduced
bandwidth use. Traffic Server is designed to improve content delivery
for enterprises, Internet service providers (ISPs), backbone
providers, and large intranets by maximizing existing and available
bandwidth.
