Signals
=======

SIGHUP
  This signal causes a reconfiguration event, equivalent to running :program:`traffic_ctl config reload`.

SIGINT, SIGTERM
  These signals cause :program:`traffic_manager` to exit after also shutting down :program:`traffic_server`.

SIGUSR2
  This signal causes the :program:`traffic_manager` and :program:`traffic_server` processes to close
  and reopen their file descriptors for all of their log files. This allows the use of external
  tools to handle log rotation and retention. For instance, logrotate(8) can be configured to rotate
  the various |ATS| logs and, via the logrotate postrotate script, send a `-SIGUSR2` to the
  :program:`traffic_manager` process. After the signal is received, |ATS| will stop logging to the
  now-rolled files and will reopen log files with the originally configured log names.

Exponential Back-off Delay
==========================

  If :program:`traffic_server` has issues communicating with  :program:`traffic_manager` after a crash,
  :program:`traffic_manager` will retry to start  :program:`traffic_server` using an exponential back-off delay,
  which will make :program:`traffic_manager` to retry starting :program:`traffic_server` from ``1s`` until it
  reaches the max ceiling time. The ceiling time is configurable  as well as the number of times that
  :program:`traffic_manager` will keep trying to start :program:`traffic_server`. *A random variance will be
  added to the sleep time on every retry*

.. note::
  For more information about this configuration please check :file:`records.config`
