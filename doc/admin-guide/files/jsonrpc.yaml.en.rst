.. _admin-jsonrpc-description:

The :file:`jsonrpc.yaml` file defines some of the configurable arguments of the
jsonrpc endpoint.

Description
===========

|TS| Implements and exposes management calls using a JSONRPC API.  This API is
base on the following two things:

* `JSON  <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_  format. Lightweight
  data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
  It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It's basically a  collection of
  name/value pairs.

* `JSONRPC 2.0 <https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ protocol. Stateless,
  light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.
  Primarily this specification defines several data structures and the rules
  around their processing.


In order for programs to communicate with |TS|, the server exposes a
``JSONRRPC 2.0`` API where programs can communicate with it. In this document you
will find some of the configurable arguments that can be changed.


.. _admnin-jsonrpc-configuration:

Configuration
=============

.. note::

   |TS| will start the |RPC| server without any need for configuration.

If a non-default configuration is needed, the following describes the configuration
structure.

File `jsonrpc.yaml` is a YAML format. The default configuration is:

.. code:: yaml

   rpc:
     enabled: true
     unix:
       restricted_api: true


===================== ==========================================================
Field Name            Description
===================== ==========================================================
``enabled``           Enable/disable toggle for the whole implementation, server
                      will not start if this is false/no
``unix``              Specific definitions as per transport.

IPC Socket (``unix``)
---------------------

===================================== ==========================================
Field Name                            Description
===================================== ==========================================
``lock_path_name``                    Lock path, including the file name.
                                      (changing this may have impacts in
                                      :program:`traffic_ctl`)
``sock_path_name``                    Sock path, including the file name. This
                                      will be used as ``sockaddr_un.sun_path``
                                      (changing this may have impacts in :program:`traffic_ctl`)
``backlog``                           Check https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html
``max_retry_on_transient_errors``     Number of times the implementation is
                                      allowed to retry when a transient error is
                                      encountered.
``restricted_api``                    Used to set rpc unix socket permissions.
                                      If restricted `0700` will be set, otherwise
                                      `0777`. ``true`` by default.

   Currently, there is only 1 communication mechanism supported. Unix Domain Sockets
