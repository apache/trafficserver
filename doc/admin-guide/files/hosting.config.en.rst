hosting.config
==============

.. configfile:: hosting.config

The :file:`hosting.config` file (by default, located in
``/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/``) allows you to assign cache volumes to
specific origin servers and/or domains so that you can manage cache
space efficiently and restrict disk usage. For step-by-step instructions
on partitioning the cache according to origin servers and/or domains,
refer to :ref:`partitioning-the-cache`.

Before you can assign cache volumes to specific
origin servers and/or domains, you must first partition your cache
according to size and protocol in the :file:`volume.config`
file.

After you modify hosting.config, navigate to the Traffic Server bin
directory and run :option:`traffic_ctl config reload` to apply your changes.

When you apply the changes to a node in a cluster, Traffic Server
automatically applies the changes to all other nodes in the cluster.

Format
======

Each line in the :file:`hosting.config` file must have one of the following
formats::

    hostname=HOST volume=NUMBERS
    domain=DOMAIN volume=NUMBERS

where ``HOST`` is the fully-qualified hostname of the origin server
whose content you want to store on a particular volume (for example,
``www.myhost.com``); ``DOMAIN`` is the domain whose content you
want to store on a particular partition (for example, ``mydomain.com``);
and ``NUMBERS`` is a comma-separated list of the partitions on
which you want to store the content that belongs to the origin server or
domain listed. The partition numbers must be valid numbers listed in the
:file:`volume.config`.

**Note:** To allocate more than one partition to an origin server or
domain, you must enter the partitions in a comma-separated list on one
line, as shown in the example below. The
:file:`hosting.config` file cannot contain multiple entries
for the same origin server or domain.

Generic Partition
=================

When configuring the :file:`hosting.config` file, you must assign a generic
volume to use for content that does not belong to any of the origin
servers or domains listed. If all volumes for a particular origin
server become corrupt, Traffic Server will also use the generic
volume to store content for that origin server.

The generic volume must have the following format::

    hostname=* volume=NUMBERS

where ``NUMBERS`` is a comma-separated list of generic
volumes.

Examples
========

The following example configures Traffic Server to store content from
the domain ``mydomain.com`` in volume 1 and content from
``www.myhost.com`` in volume 2. Traffic Server stores content from
all other origin servers in volumes 3 and 4.

::

    domain=mydomain.com volume=1
    hostname=www.myhost.com volume=2
    hostname=* volume=3,4
