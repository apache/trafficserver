.. configfile:: sni.yaml

Description
===========

This file is used to configure aspects of TLS connection handling for both inbound and outbound
connections. With the exception of ``host_sni_policy`` (see the description below), the configuration is driven by the SNI values provided by the inbound connection. The
file consists of a set of configuration items, each identified by an SNI value and optionally one or more port ranges (``fqdn``, ``inbound_port_ranges``).
When an inbound TLS connection is made, the SNI value from the TLS negotiation is matched against
the items specified by this file and if there is a match, the values specified in that item override
the defaults. This is done during the inbound connection processing; some outbound properties
can be overridden again later, such as via :file:`remap.config` or plugins.

By default this is named :file:`sni.yaml`. The filename can be changed by setting
:ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.servername.filename`. This file is loaded on start up and by
:option:`traffic_ctl config reload` if the file has been modified since process start.

The configuration file is YAML-based. After parsing the configuration, a list of tables will be the result.
Each table is a set of key / value pairs that create a configuration item. This configuration file accepts
wildcard entries. To apply an SNI based setting on all the server names with a common upper level domain name,
the user needs to enter the FQDN in the configuration with a ``*.`` followed by the common domain name. (``*.yahoo.com`` for example).

For some settings, there is no guarantee that they will be applied to a connection under certain conditions.
An established TLS connection may be reused for another server name if itâ€™s used for HTTP/2. This also means that settings
for server name A may affects requests for server name B as well. See https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/18/http2-connection-coalescing/
for a more detailed description of HTTP/2 connection coalescing. A similar thing can happen on a QUIC connection for HTTP/3 as well.

The following fields make up the key for each item in the configuration file.

========================= ========= ========================================================================================
Key                       Direction Meaning
========================= ========= ========================================================================================
fqdn                      Both      Fully Qualified Domain Name. Matching depends on the order of entries (like :file:`remap.config`)

                                    Wildcard Support:
                                      1. Allow single left-most ``*``
                                      2. Do NOT support regex
                                      3. Allow ``$1`` (capturing) support in the ``tunnel_route`` field

                                      For example:
                                        Supported:
                                          - ``*.example.com``
                                          - ``*``

                                        NOT Supported:
                                          - ``foo[0-9]+.example.com`` (regex)
                                          - ``bar.*.example.net`` (``*`` in the middle)
                                          - ``*.bar.*.com`` (multiple ``*``)
                                          - ``*.*.baz.com`` (multiple ``*``)
                                          - ``baz*.example.net`` (partial wildcard)
                                          - ``*baz.example.net`` (partial wildcard)
                                          - ``b*z.example.net`` (partial wildcard)

inbound_port_ranges       Inbound   The port ranges for the inbound connection in the form ``port`` or
                                    ``min-max``.

                                    For example:

                                       .. code-block:: yaml

                                          sni:
                                            - fqdn: example.com
                                              inbound_port_ranges:
                                              - 443
                                              - 8080-8086
                                            - fqdn: other.com
                                              inbound_port_ranges: 443

                                    would match all requests with an SNI for example.com on port 443, and on ports
                                    8080 through 8086 inclusive, and all
                                    requests with an SNI for other.com on port
                                    443

========================= ========= ========================================================================================

The following fields are the directives that determine the behavior of connections matching the key.

======================================== ========= ========================================================================================
Key                                      Direction Meaning
======================================== ========= ========================================================================================
ip_allow                                 Inbound   Specify a list of client IP address, subnets, or ranges what are allowed to complete
                                                   the connection. This list is comma separated. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified.
                                                   Here is an example list ::

                                                      192.168.1.0/24,192.168.10.1-192.168.10.4

                                                   This would allow connections
                                                   from clients in the 19.168.1.0 network or in the range from 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.1.4.

                                                   Alternatively, the path to a file containing
                                                   the list of IP addresses can be specified in
                                                   the form of ``"@path_to_file"``. The IP
                                                   addresses in the file can be either
                                                   comma-separated or line-separated. If a
                                                   given file path does not begin with ``/``,
                                                   it must be relative to the Traffic Server
                                                   configuration directory. Here is an example
                                                   showing this form of the configuration:

                                                   ``ip_allow: "@ip_dir/example.com.ip.txt"``

verify_server_policy                     Outbound  One of the values :code:`DISABLED`, :code:`PERMISSIVE`, or :code:`ENFORCED`.

                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.verify.server.policy`.
                                                   This controls how |TS| evaluated the origin certificate.

verify_server_properties                 Outbound  One of the values :code:`NONE`, :code:`SIGNATURE`, :code:`NAME`, and :code:`ALL`

                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.verify.server.properties`.
                                                   This controls what |TS| checks when evaluating the origin certificate.

verify_client                            Outbound  One of the values :code:`NONE`, :code:`MODERATE`, or :code:`STRICT`.
                                                   If ``NONE`` is specified, |TS| requests no certificate.  If ``MODERATE`` is specified
                                                   |TS| will verify a certificate that is presented by the client, but it will not
                                                   fail the TLS handshake if no certificate is presented.  If ``STRICT`` is specified
                                                   the client must present a certificate during the TLS handshake.

                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.certification_level`.

verify_client_ca_certs                   Both      Specifies an alternate set of certificate authority certs to use to verify the
                                                   client cert.  The value must be either a file path, or a nested set of key /
                                                   value pairs.  If the value is a file path, it must specify a file containing the
                                                   CA certs.  Otherwise, there should be up to two nested pairs.  The possible keys
                                                   are ``file`` and ``dir``.  The value for ``file`` must be a file path for a file
                                                   containing CA certs.  The value for ``dir`` must be a file path for an OpenSSL
                                                   X509 hashed directory containing CA certs.  If a given file path does not begin
                                                   with ``/`` , it must be relative to the |TS| configuration directory.
                                                   ``verify_client_ca_certs`` can only be used with capabilities provided by
                                                   OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.

host_sni_policy                          Inbound   One of the values :code:`DISABLED`, :code:`PERMISSIVE`, or :code:`ENFORCED`.

                                                   If not specified, the value of :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.host_sni_policy` is used.
                                                   This controls how policy impacting mismatches between host header and SNI values are
                                                   dealt with.  For details about how this configuration behaves, see the corresponding
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.host_sni_policy` :file:`records.yaml` documentation.

                                                   Note that this particular configuration will be inspected at the time the HTTP Host
                                                   header field is processed. Further, this policy check will be keyed off of the Host header
                                                   field value rather than the SNI in this :file:`sni.yaml` file. This is done because
                                                   the Host header field is ultimately the resource that will be retrieved from the
                                                   origin and the administrator will intend to guard this resource rather than the SNI,
                                                   which a malicious user may alter to some other server value whose policies are more
                                                   lenient than the host he is trying to access.

valid_tls_version_min_in                 Inbound   This specifies the minimum TLS version that will be offered to user agents during
                                                   the TLS negotiation.  This replaces the global settings in
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.server.version.min`,
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1`, :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_1`,
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_2`, and :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_3.enabled`. The potential
                                                   values are TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, and TLSv1_3. This key is only valid for OpenSSL
                                                   1.1.0 and later and BoringSSL. Older versions of OpenSSL do not provide a hook early enough to update
                                                   the SSL object.  It is a syntax error for |TS| built against earlier versions.

valid_tls_version_max_in                 Inbound   This specifies the maximum TLS version that will be offered to user agents during
                                                   the TLS negotiation.  This replaces the global settings in
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.server.version.max`,
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1`, :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_1`,
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_2`, and :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_3.enabled`. The potential
                                                   values are TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, and TLSv1_3. This key is only valid for OpenSSL
                                                   1.1.0 and later and BoringSSL. Older versions of OpenSSL do not provide a hook early enough to update
                                                   the SSL object.  It is a syntax error for |TS| built against earlier versions.

valid_tls_versions_in                    Inbound   Deprecated. This specifies the list of TLS protocols that will be offered to user agents during
                                                   the TLS negotiation.  This replaces the global settings in

                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_2`, and :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.TLSv1_3.enabled`. The potential
                                                   values are TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, and TLSv1_3.  You must list all protocols that |TS|
                                                   should offer to the client when using this key.  This key is only valid for OpenSSL
                                                   1.1.0 and later and BoringSSL. Older versions of OpenSSL do not provide a hook early enough to update

client_cert                              Outbound  The file containing the client certificate to use for the outbound connection.

                                                   If this is relative, it is relative to the path in
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.path`. If not set
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.filename` is used.

client_key                               Outbound  The file containing the client private key that corresponds to the certificate
                                                   for the outbound connection.

                                                   If this is relative, it is relative to the path in

                                                   |TS| tries to use a private key in client_cert.  Otherwise,
                                                   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.private_key.filename` is used.

                                                   If not specified, the value of :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.sni_policy` is used.

http2                                    Inbound   Indicates whether the H2 protocol should be added to or removed from the
                                                   protocol negotiation list.  The valid values are :code:`on` or :code:`off`.

http2_buffer_water_mark                  Inbound   Specifies the high water mark for all HTTP/2 frames on an outgoing connection.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.default_buffer_water_mark`.

http2_initial_window_size_in             Inbound   Specifies the initial HTTP/2 stream window size for inbound connections that
                                                   |TS| as a receiver advertises to the peer.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.initial_window_size_in`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_settings_frames_per_minute     Inbound   Specifies how many SETTINGS frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_settings_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_ping_frames_per_minute         Inbound   Specifies how many PING frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_ping_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_priority_frames_per_minute     Inbound   Specifies how many PRIORITY frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_priority_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_rst_stream_frames_per_minute   Inbound   Specifies how many RST_STREAM frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_rst_stream_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_continuation_frames_per_minute Inbound   Specifies how many CONTINUATION frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_continuation_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

http2_max_empty_frames_per_minute        Inbound   Specifies how many empty frames |TS| receives per minute at maximum.
                                                   By default this is :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http2.max_empty_frames_per_minute`.
                                                   NOTE: Connection coalescing may prevent this from taking effect.

quic                                     Inbound   Indicates whether QUIC connections should be accepted. The valid values are :code:`on` or
                                                   :code:`off`. Note that this is a more specific setting to configure QUIC availability per server
                                                   name. More broadly, you will also need to configure :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.server_ports` to
                                                   open ports for QUIC.

tunnel_route                             Inbound   Destination as an FQDN and port, separated by a colon ``:``. Capturing matched wildcard in
                                                   the ``fqdn`` field is supported by ``$1``. For example: ``tunnel_route: $1.domain``.

                                                   This will forward all traffic to the specified destination without first terminating
                                                   the incoming TLS connection.

                                                   The destination port can be designated with the literal string
                                                   ``{inbound_local_port}`` to specify that |TS| should connect to the tunnel route's
                                                   port on the same destination port that the incoming connection had. For
                                                   example, if a client connected to |TS| on port ``4443`` and the associated
                                                   ``tunnel_route`` had ``{inbound_local_port}`` for the port designation, then |TS|
                                                   will connect to the specified host using port ``4443``.

                                                   The destination port can also be designated with the literal string
                                                   ``{proxy_protocol_port}``, in which case |TS| will connect to the specified host on
                                                   the port that was specified by the incoming Proxy Protocol payload. See :ref:`Proxy
                                                   Protocol <proxy-protocol>` for more information on Proxy Protocol and how it is
                                                   configured for |TS|.

                                                   Note that only one of the ``{inbound_local_port}`` and ``{proxy_protocol_port}`` literal
                                                   strings can be specified. The match group number can be used in combination with either
                                                   one of those.

                                                   For each of these tunnel targets, unless the port is explicitly specified in the target
                                                   (e.g., if the port is derived from the Proxy Protocol header), the port must be
                                                   specified in the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.connect_ports` configuration in order for
                                                   the tunnel to succeed.

forward_route                            Inbound   Destination as an FQDN and port, separated by a colon ``:``.

                                                   This is similar to tunnel_route, but it terminates the TLS connection and forwards the
                                                   decrypted traffic. |TS| will not interpret the decrypted data, so the contents do not
                                                   need to be HTTP.

partial_blind_route                      Inbound   Destination as an FQDN and port, separated by a colon ``:``.

                                                   This is similar to forward_route in that |TS| terminates the incoming TLS connection.
                                                   In addition partial_blind_route creates a new TLS connection to the specified origin.
                                                   It does not interpret the decrypted data before passing it to the origin TLS
                                                   connection, so the contents do not need to be HTTP.

tunnel_alpn                              Inbound   List of ALPN Protocol Ids for Partial Blind Tunnel.

                                                   ATS negotiates application protocol with the client on behalf of the origin server.
                                                   This only works with ``partial_blind_route``.

server_max_early_data                    Inbound   Specifies the maximum amount of early data in bytes that is permitted to be sent on a single connection.

                                                   If not specified, the value of :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.server.max_early_data` is used.

Pre-warming TLS Tunnel
----------------------

=============================== ========================================================================================
Key                             Meaning
=============================== ========================================================================================
tunnel_prewarm                  Override :ts:cv:`proxy.config.tunnel.prewarm.enabled` in records.yaml.

tunnel_prewarm_srv              Enable SRV record lookup on pre-warming. Default is ``false``.

tunnel_prewarm_rate             Rate of how many connections to pre-warm. Default is ``1.0``.

tunnel_prewarm_min              Minimum number of pre-warming queue size (per thread). Default is ``0``.

tunnel_prewarm_max              Maximum number of pre-warming queue size (per thread). Default is ``-1`` (unlimited).

tunnel_prewarm_connect_timeout  Timeout for TCP/TLS handshake (in seconds).

tunnel_prewarm_inactive_timeout Inactive timeout for connections in the pool (in seconds).
=============================== ========================================================================================

Client verification, via ``verify_client``, corresponds to setting
:ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.certification_level` for this connection as noted below.

:code:`NONE` -- ``0``
   Do not request a client certificate, ignore it if one is provided.

:code:`MODERATE` - ``1``
   Request a client certificate and do verification if one is provided. The connection is denied if the verification of the client provided certificate fails.
:code:`STRICT` - ``2``
   Request a client certificate and require one to be provided and verified.
   If the verification fails the failure is logged to :file:`diags.log` and the connection is
   denied.

Upstream (server) verification, via ``verify_server_policy`` and ``verify_server_properties``, is similar to client verification
except there is always an upstream certificate. This is equivalent to setting
:ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.verify.server.policy` and :ts:cv:`proxy.config.ssl.client.verify.server.properties` for this connection.

``verify_server_policy`` specifies how |TS| will enforce the server certificate verification.

:code:`DISABLED`
   Do not verify the upstream server certificate.

:code:`PERMISSIVE`
   Do verification of the upstream certificate but do not enforce. If the verification fails the
   failure is logged in :file:`diags.log` but the connection is allowed.

:code:`ENFORCED`
   Do verification of the upstream certificate. If verification fails, the failure is
   logged in :file:`diags.log` and the connection is denied.

In addition ``verify_server_properties`` specifies what |TS| will check when performing the verification.

:code:`NONE`
  Do not check anything in the standard |TS| verification routine.  Rely entirely on the ``TS_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_HOOK`` for evaluating the origin's certificate.

:code:`SIGNATURE`
  Check the signature of the origin certificate.

:code:`NAME`
  Verify that the SNI is in the origin certificate.

:code:`ALL`
  Verify both the signature and the SNI in the origin certificate.


If ``tunnel_route`` is specified, none of the certificate verification will be done because the TLS
negotiation will be tunneled to the upstream target, making those values irrelevant for that
configuration item. This option is explained in more detail in :ref:`sni-routing`.

Examples
========

Disable HTTP/2 for ``no-http2.example.com``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sni:
   - fqdn: no-http2.example.com
     http2: off

Require client certificate verification for ``foo.com`` and any server name ending with ``.yahoo.com``. Therefore, client
request for a server name ending with yahoo.com (e.g., def.yahoo.com, abc.yahoo.com etc.) will cause |TS| require and verify
the client certificate.

For ``foo.com``, if the user agent sets the host header to foo.com but the SNI to some other value, |TS| will warn about the
mismatch but continue to process the request.  Mismatches for the other domains will cause |TS| to warn and return 403.

|TS| will allow a client certificate to be provided for ``example.com`` and if it is, |TS| will require the
certificate to be valid.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sni:
   - fqdn: example.com
     verify_client: MODERATE
   - fqdn: 'foo.com'
     verify_client: STRICT
     host_sni_policy: PERMISSIVE
   - fqdn: '*.yahoo.com'
     verify_client: STRICT

Disable outbound server certificate verification for ``trusted.example.com`` and require a valid
client certificate.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sni:
   - fqdn: trusted.example.com
     verify_server_policy: DISABLED
     verify_client: STRICT

Use FQDN captured group to match in ``tunnel_route``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sni:
   - fqdn: '*.foo.com'
     tunnel_route: '$1.myfoo'

FQDN ``some.foo.com`` will match and the captured string will be replaced in the ``tunnel_route`` which will end up being
``some.myfoo``.

Establish a blind tunnel to the backend server, connecting to the server's port with the destination port specified
in the Proxy Protocol from the inbound connection. Remember to add any expected values for ``{proxy_protocol_port}`` to
the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.connect_ports` list.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sni:
   - fqdn: tunnel-pp.example.com
     tunnel_route: my.backend.example.com:{proxy_protocol_port}
