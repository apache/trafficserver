Statistics
**********

Statistics provide a live view into the current state of |TS| and many of the
plugins which may be usd with it. They can, and generally should be, used as a
core piece in any performance and operational monitoring infrastructure as they
expose a much greater detail about the workings of |TS| than can reliably be
obtained through any other means.
