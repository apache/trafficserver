Event Loop
**********

The core of network processing in |TS| is the :term:`event loop`. This loop executes any pending
events and performs I/O operations on network connections. The time spent in the event loop is a
critical component of latency as any network connection has at most one I/O operation per loop. The
general mechanism is

*  Dispatch any pending events.

*  Check for any pending I/O activity. This waits a variable amount of time, but at most
   :ts:cv:`proxy.config.thread.max_heartbeat_mseconds` milliseconds. It is reduced to wake up before
   the next scheduled event. Although this is done in milliseconds, system timers are
   rarely that accurate.

*  For each network connection that has pending I/O, dispatch an event to the corresponding network
   virtual connection object.

*  Dispatch any events generated while handling I/O in the previous steps.

Event loops that take a long time will have a noticeable impact on transaction latency. There are a
number of statistics gathered to help determine if this is the problem. Because instantaneous values
are not useful, the data is gathered in three different time buckets - 10, 100, and 1000 seconds.
There is a parallel set of statistics for each, and each larger time period includes the smaller
ones. The statistic values are all "for this time period". For example, the statistic
"proxy.process.eventloop.count.100s" is "the number of event loops executed in the last 100
seconds". The histogram metrics provide a more detailed look at the distribution of event loop times
to distinguish whether long times are common or an outlier.

In general, the maximum loop time will create a floor under response latency. If that is frequently
high then it is likely transactions are experiencing significant latency.

.. rubric:: Histogram Metrics

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.eventloop.time.*ms integer

    This is a set of statistics that provide a histogram of event loop times. Each is labeled
    with a value indicating the minimum time for the bucket. The maximum is less than the minimum
    of the next bucket. E.g. there is a "10ms" and a "20ms" statistic. The "10ms" statistic counts
    the number of times the event loop took at least 10ms and less than 20ms. The exception is the
    last bucket which has no maximum. The histogram is semi-logarithmic so that bucket sizes increase
    exponentially with smaller intermediate steps. Every 60 seconds the accumulated values are
    decreased by half to provide an exponential decay of recent activity. The current set of
    statistics is ::

    This is an idle instance therefore the values are clustered strongly on 0 (less than 5ms) and
    60ms (the default wait for I/O timeout).

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.api.time.*ms integer

   A set of statistics that provide a histogram of total time spent in plugins. This is sampled
   per plugin, rather than the aggregate value for milestone :c:macro:`TS_MILESTONE_PLUGIN_TOTAL`.

   See :ts:stat:`proxy.process.eventloop.time.*ms` for technical details.
