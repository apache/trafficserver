HostDB
******

The HostDB component of |TS| manages origin server name resolution and host
health checks. The statistics documented here can help to ensure that your |TS|
instances are not spending an unreasonable amount of timing resolving your
origin servers' hostnames prior to object revalidation or retrieval.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.bytes integer
   :type: counter
   :units: bytes

   Represents the number of bytes allocated to the HostDB lookup cache.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.re_dns_on_reload integer
   :type: counter

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.total_entries integer
   :type: counter

   Represents the total number of host entries currently in the HostDB lookup
   cache.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.total_hits integer
   :type: counter

   Represents the total number of origin server name resolutions which were
   satisfied by entries in the HostDB lookup cache, since statistics collection
   began.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.total_lookups integer
   :type: counter

   Represents the total number of origin server name resolutions which have been
   performed, since statistics collection began, regardless of whether they were
   satisfied by the HostDB lookup cache or required DNS lookups.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.ttl_expires integer
   :type: gauge
   :units: seconds

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.ttl float
   :type: gauge
   :units: seconds

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.current_items integer
   :type: gauge

   The number of distinct host records in the HostDB cache.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.current_size integer
   :type: gauge
   :units: bytes

   The total size of all host records in the HostDB cache.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.last_sync.time integer
   :type: gauge

   The Unix timestamp of the last successful sync of HostDB's cache to disk

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.last_sync.total_items integer
   :type: gauge

   The number of distinct host records in the HostDB cache that where synced to disk.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.last_sync.total_size integer
   :type: gauge
   :units: bytes

   The total size of all host records in the HostDB cache that where synced to disk.

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.total_failed_inserts integer
   :type: counter

   The number of host records that where unable to be inserted into HostDB's cache

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.total_hits integer
   :type: counter

   The total number of successful lookups for host records from HostDB's cache

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.total_inserts integer
   :type: counter

   The number host records inserted into HostDB's cache

.. ts:stat:: global proxy.process.hostdb.cache.total_lookups integer
   :type: counter

   The total number of lookups for host records from HostDB's cache
