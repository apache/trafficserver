=============
traffic.out
=============

.. logfile:: traffic.out

Debug level messages are written to this file. In particular if a :ts:cv:`debug
tag <proxy.config.diags.debug.tags>` is enabled output for that tag is placed in
this file. This applies to both the |TS| core and plugins. This file also
contains some generic operational messages which track |TS| starting and
stopping. If |TS| crashes a stack trace should be put in this file.

Most messages will have a timestamp, process tag, and a thread pointer.::

   [Oct 13 14:40:46.134] Server {0x2ae95ff5ce80} DIAG: (header_freq.init) initializing plugin

The process tag is "Server" indicating :program:`traffic_server`. It was logged
from the thread with an instance address of `0x2ae95ff5ce80` and had a priority
level of "DIAG" ("diagnostic"). The message is from a plugin, logged because the
debug tag "header_freq.init" was active.

=============
diags.log
=============

.. logfile:: diags.log

Diagnostic output file. Logging messages with a priority higher than "DEBUG" are
sent to this file. If there is an problem that may cause |TS| to malfunction or
not start up this is the first file that should be checked for logging messages.

Messages in this file follow the same general format as for :file:`traffic.out`.

=============
error.log
=============

.. logfile:: error.log

Operational error messages are placed here. These messages are about errors in
transactions, not |TS| itself. For instance if a user agent request is denied
that will be logged here.
