Log Formats
***********

This document provides a reference for all the different logging formats |TS|
supports. Rather than just reading about those formats, you may also want to
try our `online event log builder <http://trafficserver.apache.org/logbuilder/>`_
for an interactive way of building and understanding log formats.

.. _admin-logging-binary-v-ascii:

Binary or ASCII?
================

You can configure |TS| to create event log files in either of the following:

ASCII
   These files are human-readable and can be processed using standard,
   off-the-shelf log analysis tools. However, |TS| must perform additional
   processing to create the files in ASCII, which mildly impacts system
   overhead. ASCII files also tend to be larger than the equivalent binary
   files. By default, ASCII log files have a ``.log`` filename extension.

Binary
   These files generate lower system overhead and generally occupy less space
   on the disk than ASCII files (depending on the type of information being
   logged). However, you must use a converter application before you can read
   or analyze binary files via standard tools. By default, binary log files use
   a ``.blog`` filename extension.

While binary log files typically require less disk space, there are exceptions.

For example, the value ``0`` (zero) requires only one byte to store in ASCII,
but requires four bytes when stored as a binary integer.  Conversely, if you
define a custom format that logs IP addresses, then a binary log file would
only require four bytes of storage per 32-bit address. However, the same IP
address stored in dot notation would require around 15 characters (bytes) in an
ASCII log file.

It is wise to consider the type of data that will be logged before you select
ASCII or binary for your log files, if your decision is being driven by storage
space concerns. For example, you might try logging to both formats
simultaneously for a representative period of time and compare the storage
requirements of the two logs to determine whether one or the other provides
any measurable savings.

Defining Log Objects
====================

To perform any logging at all on your |TS| nodes, you must have at least one
:ref:`LogObject` defined in :file:`logs_xml.config`. These definitions configure
what logs will be created, the format they will use (covered in the sections
:ref:`admin-monitoring-logging-format-standard` and
:ref:`admin-monitoring-logging-format-custom`), any filters which may be
applied to events before logging them, and when or how the logs will be rolled.

Log Filters
===========

:ref:`LogFilter` objects, configured in :file:`logs_xml.config` allow you to
create filters, which may be applied to :ref:`LogObject` definitions, limiting
the types of entries which will be included in the log output. This may be
useful if your |TS| nodes receive many events which you have no need to log or
analyze.

.. _admin-monitoring-logging-format-standard:

Standard Formats
================

The standard log formats include Squid, Netscape Common, Netscape extended, and
Netscape Extended-2. The standard log file formats can be analyzed with a wide
variety of off-the-shelf log-analysis packages. You should use one of the
standard event log formats unless you need information that these formats do
not provide.

These formats may be used by enabling the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.log.custom_logs_enabled`
setting in :file:`records.config` and adding appropriate entries to
:file:`logs_xml.config`.

====== ======== ===============================================================

.. _admin-monitoring-logging-format-custom:

Custom Formats
==============

Defining a Format
-----------------

Custom logging formats in |TS| are defined by editing :file:`logs_xml.config`
and adding new :ref:`LogFormat` entries for each format you wish to define. The
syntax is fairly simple: every :ref:`LogFormat` element should contain at least
two child elements (additional elements are used for features such as log
summarization and are covered elsewhere):

-  A ``<Name>`` which contains an arbitrary string (using only the allowed
   characters: ``[a-z0-9]``) naming your custom format.

-  A ``<Format>`` which defines the fields that will populate each entry in the
   custom logs, as well as the order in which they appear.

A very simple example format, which contains only the timestamp of when the
event began and the canonical URL of the request, and named *myformat* would
be written as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

   <LogFormat>
     <Name = "myformat"/>
     <Format = "%<cqtq> %<cauc>"/>
   </LogFormat>

You may include as many custom field codes as you wish. The full list of codes
available can be found in :ref:`custom-logging-fields`. You may also include
any literal characters in your format. For example, if we wished to separate
the timestamp and canonical URL in our customer format above with a slash
instead of a space, or even a slash surrounded by spaces, we could do so by
just adding the desired characters to the format string::

    %<cqtq> / %<cauc>

You may define as many custom formats as you wish. To apply changes to custom
formats, you will need to run the command :option:`traffic_line -x` after
saving your changes to :file:`logs_xml.config`.

.. _pscl:

``pscl``
    The length of the |TS| response to the client (in bytes).

.. _psct:

    first request was a cache miss and came from *IP1* for server
    *S* and the second request for server *S* resolved to
    *IP2* but came from the cache, then the log entry for the
    second request will show *IP2*.

.. _shn:

.. _sscl:

``sscl``
    The response length (in bytes) from origin server to |TS|.

    The time spent accessing the origin (in milliseconds); the time is
    measured from the time the connection with the origin is established
    to the time the connection is closed.

.. _stmsh:

``stmsh``
    Same as ``stms`` but in hexadecimal.

.. _stmsf:

``stmsf``
    The time |TS| spends accessing the origin as a fractional
    number of seconds. That is, the time is formated as a floating-point
    number, instead of an integer as in ``stms``.

    For example: if the time is 1500 milliseconds, then this field
    displays 1.5 while the ``stms`` field displays 1500 and the ``sts``
    field displays 1.

.. _sts:

``sts``
    The time |TS| spends accessing the origin, in seconds.

.. _sstc:

``sstc``
    The number of transactions between |TS| and the origin server
    from a single server session. A value greater than 0 indicates connection
    reuse.

.. _ttms:

``ttms``
    The time |TS| spends processing the client request; the
    number of milliseconds between the time the client establishes the
    connection with |TS| and the time |TS| sends the
    last byte of the response back to the client.

.. _ttmsh:

``ttmsh``
    Same as ``ttms`` but in hexadecimal.

.. _ttmsf:

``ttmsf``
    The time |TS| spends processing the client request as a
    fractional number of seconds. Time is specified in millisecond
    resolution; however, instead of formatting the output as an integer
    (as with ``ttms``), the display is formatted as a floating-point
    number representing a fractional number of seconds.

    For example: if the time is 1500 milliseconds, then this field
    displays 1.5 while the ``ttms`` field displays 1500 and the ``tts``
    field displays 1.

.. _tts:

``tts``
    The time |TS| spends processing the client request; the
    number of seconds between the time at which the client establishes
    the connection with |TS| and the time at which Traffic
    Server sends the last byte of the response back to the client.

.. _log-field-slicing:

Log Field Slicing
-----------------

It is sometimes desirable to slice a log field to limit the length of a given
log field's output.

Log Field slicing can be specified as below::

    %<field[start:end]>
    %<{field}container[start:end]>

Omitting the slice notation defaults to the entire log field.

Slice notation only applies to a log field that is of type string and can not
be applied to IPs or timestamp which are converted to string from integer.

The below slice specifiers are allowed.

``[start:end]``
          Log field value from start through end-1
``[start:]``
          Log field value from start through the rest of the string
``[:end]``
          Log field value from the beginning through end-1
``[:]``
          Default - entire Log field

Some examples below ::

  '%<cqup>'       // the whole characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup>[:]'    // the whole characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[0:30]>' // the first 30 characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[-10:]>' // the last 10 characters of <cqup>.
  '%<cqup[:-5]>'  // everything except the last 5 characters of <cqup>.

.. _admin-monitoring-logging-cache-result-codes:

Cache Result Codes
==================

The following table describes the cache result codes in Squid and
Netscape log files.

``TCP_HIT``
    A valid copy of the requested object was in the cache and Traffic
    Server sent the object to the client.

``TCP_MISS``
    The requested object was not in cache, so |TS| retrieved
    the object from the origin server (or a parent proxy) and sent it to
    the client.

``TCP_REFRESH_HIT``
    The object was in the cache, but it was stale. |TS| made an
    ``if-modified-since`` request to the origin server and the
    origin server sent a ``304`` not-modified response. Traffic
    Server sent the cached object to the client.

``TCP_REF_FAIL_HIT``
    The object was in the cache but was stale. |TS| made an
    ``if-modified-since`` request to the origin server but the server
    did not respond. |TS| sent the cached object to the
    client.

``TCP_REFRESH_MISS``
    The object was in the cache but was stale. |TS| made an
    ``if-modified-since`` request to the origin server and the server
    returned a new object. |TS| served the new object to the
    client.

``TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH``
    The client issued a request with a ``no-cache`` header. Traffic
    Server obtained the requested object from the origin server and sent
    a copy to the client. |TS| deleted the previous copy of
    the object from cache.

``TCP_IMS_HIT``
    The client issued an ``if-modified-since`` request and the object
    was in cache and fresher than the IMS date, or an
    ``if-modified-since`` request to the origin server revealed the
    cached object was fresh. |TS| served the cached object to
    the client.

``TCP_IMS_MISS``
    The client issued an
    ``if-modified-since request`` and the object was either not in
    cache or was stale in cache. |TS| sent an
    ``if-modified-since request`` to the origin server and received the
    new object. |TS| sent the updated object to the client.

``TCP_SWAPFAIL``
    The object was in the cache but could not be accessed. The client
    did not receive the object.

``ERR_CLIENT_ABORT``
    The client disconnected before the complete object was sent.

``ERR_CONNECT_FAIL``
    |TS| could not reach the origin server.

``ERR_DNS_FAIL``
    The Domain Name Server (DNS) could not resolve the origin server
    name, or no DNS could be reached.

``ERR_INVALID_REQ``
    The client HTTP request was invalid. (|TS| forwards
    requests with unknown methods to the origin server.)

``ERR_READ_TIMEOUT``
    The origin server did not respond to |TS|'s request within
    the timeout interval.

``ERR_PROXY_DENIED``
    Client service was denied.

``ERR_UNKNOWN``
    The client connected, but subsequently disconnected without sending
    a request.
