Summary Logs
************

Due to the speed and efficiency of |TS|, a heavily-loaded node will generate
many events and the event logs can quickly grow to very large sizes.  Using
SQL-like aggregate operators, you can configure |TS| to create summary log
files that summarize a set of log entries over a specified period of time. This
can significantly reduce the size of the log files generated.

To generate a summary log file, create a :ref:`LogFormat` object in the
XML-based logging configuration :file:`logs_xml.config` using the SQL-like
aggregate operators below. You can apply each of these operators to specific
fields, over a specified interval.

-  ``COUNT``
-  ``SUM``
-  ``AVERAGE``
-  ``FIRST``
-  ``LAST``

To create a summary log file format:

#. Define the format of the log file in :file:`logs_xml.config` as follows::

       <LogFormat>
         <Name = "summary"/>
         <Format = "%<operator(field)> : %<operator(field)>"/>
         <Interval = "n"/>
       </LogFormat>

   Where ``operator`` is one of the five aggregate operators (``COUNT``,
   ``SUM``, ``AVERAGE``, ``FIRST``, ``LAST``); ``field`` is the logging field
   you want to aggregate; and ``n`` is the interval (in seconds) between
   summary log entries.

   You can specify more than one ``operator`` in the format line. For more
   information, refer to :file:`logs_xml.config`.

#. Run the command :option:`traffic_ctl config reload` to apply configuration changes .

The following example format generates one entry every 10 seconds. Each entry
contains the timestamp of the last entry of the interval, a count of the number
of entries seen within that 10-second interval, and the sum of all bytes sent
to the client::

    <LogFormat>
      <Name = "summary"/>
      <Format = "%<LAST(cqts)> : %<COUNT(*)> : %<SUM(psql)>"/>
      <Interval = "10"/>
    </LogFormat>

.. important::

    You cannot create a format specification that contains
    both aggregate operators and regular fields. For example, the following
    specification would be invalid: ::

        <Format = "%<LAST(cqts)> : %<COUNT(*)> : %<SUM(psql)> : %<cqu>"/>
