Traffic Manager Alarms
**********************

|TS| signals an alarm when it detects a problem. For example, the space
allocated to event logs could be full or |TS| may not be able to write to a
configuration file.

Using a Script File for Alarms
------------------------------

Alarm messages are built into Traffic Server and cannot be changed.
However, you can write a script file to execute certain actions when an
alarm is signaled. Traffic Server provides a sample script file named
``example_alarm_bin.sh`` in the ``bin`` directory which can serve as the
basis for your custom alarm scripts.
