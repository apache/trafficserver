Audience
========

This section of the |ATS| Manual is aimed at those individuals looking to
install and configure |TS| for use as a caching proxy server. The section
assumes basic knowledge of the command line and system administration tasks.
Detailed steps are provided on how to build and configure the software, so
even if you have never used a compiler or looked at a Makefile before, you
will find everything you need in the following chapters to get you up and
running with your own instance of |TS|. Or so is our hope.

Should you encounter problems, or find any of the instructions unclear or
lacking, please seek help through one of the avenues listed in
:ref:`intro-other-resources`.
