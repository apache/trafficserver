This plugin implements the memcache protocol for cache contents.

Installation
============

Add the following line to :file:`plugin.config`::

    tsmemcache.so 11211

In this case, the plugin will use the default behaviour:

-  Listen for memcache traffic on the default memcache port 11211
-  Write memcache data to the cache in the background (without waiting)

Configuration
=============

Alternatively, a configuration can also be specified::

    tsmemcache.so <path-to-plugin>/sample.tsmemcache.config

After modifying plugin.config, restart traffic server (sudo traffic_ctl
server restart) the configuration is also re-read when a management
update is given (sudo traffic_ctl config reload)

Options
=======

Flags and options are:

``port``: A single port to listen on for memcache protocol commands.

Options in the code:
``TSMEMCACHE_WRITE_SYNC`` whether or not to wait for the write to complete.
