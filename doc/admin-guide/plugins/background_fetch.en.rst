This is a plugin for Apache Traffic Server that allows you to proactively
fetch content from Origin in a way that it will fill the object into
cache. This is particularly useful when all (or most) of your client requests
are of the byte-Range type. The underlying problem being that Traffic Server
is not able to cache request / responses with byte ranges.

Using the plugin
----------------

This plugin functions as either a global or per remap plugin, and it takes
an optional argument for specifying a config file with inclusion or
exclusion criteria. The config file can be specified both via an absolute
path or via a relative path to the install dir

To activate the plugin in global mode, in :file:`plugin.config`, simply add::

  background_fetch.so --config <config-file>

To activate the plugin in per remap mode, in :file:`remap.config`, simply append the
below to the specific remap line::

  @plugin=background_fetch.so @pparam=<config-file>

Functionality
-------------

Examining the responses from origin, we decide to trigger a background fetch
of the original (Client) request under these conditions:

- The request is a ``GET`` request (we only support these right now)
- The response is a ``206`` response
- The original client request, and the Origin server response, is clearly
  indicating that the response is cacheable. This uses the new API
  c:func:`TSHttpTxnIsCacheable()`, which also implies honoring current
  Traffic Server configurations.


Once deemed a good candidate to performance a background fetch, we'll replay
the original client request through the Traffic Server proxy again, except
this time eliminating the ``Range`` header. This is transparent to the
original client request, which continues as normal.

Only one background fetch per URL is ever performed, making sure we do not
accidentally put pressure on the origin servers.

The plugin now supports a config file that can specify exclusion or inclusion of
background fetch based on any arbitrary header or client-ip::

  background_fetch.so --config <config-file>

The contents of the config-file could be as below::

  include User-Agent ABCDEF
  exclude User-Agent *
  exclude Content-Type text
  exclude X-Foo-Bar text
  exclude Content-Length <1000

The plugin also now supports per remap activation. To activate the plugin for
a given remap, add the below on the remap line::

  @plugin=background_fetch.so @pparam=<config-file>

Future additions
----------------

- Limiting the background fetches to content of certain sizes
