Block Errors Plugin
*******************

Description
===========
The `block_errors` plugin blocks connections or downgrades the protocol from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 for clients that have too many HTTP/2 errors on the server.

The plugin tracks users based on their IP address and blocks them for a configurable amount of time.  `block_errors` can be configured to either block or downgrade the protocol, only use HTTP/1.1, for any new connections.
The existing connection that experience errors and is over the error limit will be closed.  The plugin also supports on the fly configuration changes using the `traffic_ctl` command.


Configuration
=============

To enable the `block_errors` plugin, insert the following line in :file:`plugin.config`:

    block_errors.so

Additional configuration options are available and can be set in :file:`plugin.config`:

    block_errors.so <error limit> <timeout> <shutdown> <enable>

- ``error limit``: The number of errors allowed before blocking the client. Default: 1000 (per minute)
- ``timeout``: The time in minutes to block the client. Default: 4 (minutes)
- ``shutdown``: Shutdown (1) or downgrade (0) the protocol for new connections. Default: 0 (downgrade to HTTP/1.1)
- ``enable``: Enable (1) or disable (0) the plugin. Default: 1 (enabled)

Example Configuration
=====================

    block_errors.so 1000 4 0 1

Run Time Configuration
======================
The plugin can be configured at run time using the `traffic_ctl` command.  The following commands are available:

- ``block_errors.error_limit``: Set the error limit.  Takes a single argument, the number of errors allowed before blocking the client.
- ``block_errors.timeout``: Set the block timeout.  Takes a single argument, the number of minutes to block the client.
- ``block_errors.shutdown``: Set the shutdown mode.  Takes a single argument, 0 to downgrade to HTTP/1.1, 1 to close the connection.
- ``block_errors.enable``: Enable or disable the plugin.  Takes a single argument, 0 to disable, 1 to enable.

Example Run Time Configuration
==============================

    traffic_ctl plugin msg block_errors.error_limit 10000

    traffic_ctl plugin msg block_errors.timeout 10

    traffic_ctl plugin msg block_errors.shutdown 1

    traffic_ctl plugin msg block_errors.enable 1
