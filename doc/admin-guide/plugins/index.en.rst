Overview
========

One of the key features of |ATS| is its modularity. Features that aren't needed
in the core simply aren't there. This helps to provide an additional guarantee
that our core can remain fast by concentrating on the things that we always
provide: caching and proxying.

All other functionality can be moved into plugins and by offering a consistent
C API, everyone can implement their own functionality, without having to touch
the core.

Stable plugins
==============

Plugins that are considered stable are installed by default in |TS| releases.

Experimental plugins
====================

Plugins that are considered experimental are located in the
`plugins/experimental <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=tree;f=plugins/experimental;hb=HEAD>`_
directory of the |TS| source tree. Experimental plugins can be compiled by passing the
`--enable-experimental-plugins` option to `configure`::

    $ autoconf -i
    $ ./configure --enable-experimental-plugins
    $ make
