TCPInfo Plugin
**************

This global plugin logs TCP metrics at various points in the HTTP
processing pipeline. The TCP information is retrieved by the
:manpage:`getsockopt(2)` function using the ``TCP_INFO`` option.
This is only supported on systems that support the ``TCP_INFO``
option, currently Linux and BSD.

Plugin Options
--------------

The following options may be specified in :file:`plugin.config`:

.. NOTE: if the option name is not long enough, docutils will not
   add the colspan attribute and the options table formatting will
   be all messed up. Just a trap for young players.

--hooks=NAMELIST
  This option specifies when TCP information should be logged. The
  argument is a comma-separated list of the event names listed
  below. TCP information will be sampled and logged each time the
  specified set of events occurs.

  ==============  ===============================================
   Event Name     Triggered when
  ==============  ===============================================
  send_resp_hdr   The server begins sending an HTTP response.
  ssn_close       The TCP connection closes.
  ssn_start       A new TCP connection is accepted.
  txn_close       A HTTP transaction is completed.
  txn_start       A HTTP transaction is initiated.
  ==============  ===============================================

--log-file=NAME
  This specifies the base name of the file where TCP information
  should be logged. If this option is not specified, the name
  ``tcpinfo`` is used. Traffic Server will automatically append
  the ``.log`` suffix.

--log-level=LEVEL
  The log level can be either ``1`` to log only the round trip
  time estimate, or ``2`` to log the complete set of TCP information.

  The following fields are logged when the log level is ``1``:

  ==========    ==================================================
  Field Name    Description
  ==========    ==================================================
  timestamp     Event timestamp
  event         Event name (one of the names listed above)
  client        Client IP address
  server        Server IP address
  rtt           Estimated round trip time in microseconds
  ==========    ==================================================

  The following fields are logged when the log level is ``2``:

  ==============    ==================================================
  Field Name        Description
  ==============    ==================================================
  timestamp         Event timestamp
  event             Event name (one of the names listed above)
  client            Client IP address
  server            Server IP address
  rtt               Estimated round trip time in microseconds
  rttvar
  last_sent
  last_recv
  snd_cwnd
  snd_ssthresh
  rcv_ssthresh
  unacked
  sacked
  lost
  retrans
  fackets
  ==============    ==================================================

--sample-rate=COUNT
  This is the number of times per 1000 requests that the data will
  be logged.  A pseudo-random number generator is used to determine if a
  request will be logged.  The default value is 1000 and this option is
  not required to be in the configuration file.  To achieve a log rate
  of 1% you would set this value to 10.

--rolling-enabled=VALUE
  This logfile option allows you to set logfile rolling behaviour of
  the output log file  without making any changes to the global
  logging configurations.  This option overrides the
  :ts:cv:`proxy.config.output.logfile.rolling_enabled` setting in :file:`records.config`
  for the ``tcpinfo`` plugin.  The setting may range from ``0`` to ``3``.
  ``0`` disables logfile rolling.  ``1`` is the ``default`` and enables logfile
  rolling at specfic intervals set by ``--rolling-interval-sec`` discussed
  below.  ``2`` enables logfile rolling by logfile size, see
  ``--rolling-size-mb`` below.  Finally a value of ``3`` enables logfile rolling
  at specfic intervals or size, whichever occurs first using the interval or size
  settings discussed below.

--rolling-offset-hr=VALUE
  Set the hour ``0`` to ``23`` at which the output log file will roll when
  using interval rolling. Default value is ``0``.

--rolling-interval-sec=VALUE
  Set the rolling interval in seconds for the output log file. May be set
  from ``60`` to ``86400`` seconds, Defaults to ``86400``.

--rolling-size=VALUE
  Set the size in MB at which the output log file  will roll when using log size
  rolling.  Minimum value is ``10``, defaults to ``1024``. In your config file,
  you may use the K, M, or G suffix as in::

  --rolling-size=10M

Examples:
---------

This example logs the simple TCP information to ``tcp-metrics.log``
at the start of a TCP connection and once for each HTTP
transaction thereafter::

  tcpinfo.so --log-file=tcp-metrics --log-level=1 --hooks=ssn_start,txn_start

The file ``tcp-metrics.log`` will contain the following log format (with client and server both on 127.0.0.1)::

  timestamp event client server rtt
  20140414.17h40m14s ssn_start 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 153859
  20140414.17h40m14s txn_start 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 181018
  20140414.17h40m16s ssn_start 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 86869
  20140414.17h40m16s txn_start 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 19088
  20140414.17h40m16s ssn_start 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 85718
