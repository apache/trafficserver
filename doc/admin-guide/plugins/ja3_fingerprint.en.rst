JA3 Fingerprint Plugin
**********************

Description
===========

The JA3 fingerprint plugin calculates JA3 fingerprints for incoming SSL traffic. "JA3" is a method
for creating SSL/TLS client fingerprints by concatenating values in the `TLS Client Hello
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.1.2>`__ and hashing the result using `MD5
<https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/MD5_Init.html>`__ to produce a 32 character fingerprint.
A particular instance of malware tends to use the same encryption code/client, which makes it an
effective way to detect malicious clients even when superficial details are modifed. More info about
JA3 is available `here <https://github.com/salesforce/ja3>`__.

The calculated JA3 fingerprints are then appended to upstream request in the field ``X-JA3-Sig``
(to be processed at upstream). If multiple dups exist for the field name, it will append to the last 
occurrence; if none exists, it will add such a field to the headers. The signatures can also be logged locally.

Plugin Configuration
====================
.. program:: ja3_fingerprint.so

``ja3_fingerprint`` can be used as a global/remap plugin and is configured via :file:`plugin.config`
or :file:`remap.config`.

.. option:: --ja3raw

   This option cause the plugin to append the field ``X-JA3-Raw`` to proxy request. The field value
   is the raw JA3 fingerprint.

   By default this is not enabled.

.. option:: --ja3log


   This option enables logging to the file ``ja3_fingerprint.log`` in the standard logging
   directory. The format is ::

      [time] [client IP] [JA3 string] [JA3 hash]

   By default this is not enabled.

Requirement
=============

This requires OpenSSL 1.0.1, 1.0.2, or OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. OpenSSL 1.1.0 will not work due to
API changes with regard to opaque structures.

There is a potential issue with very old TLS clients which can cause a crash in the plugin. This is
due to a `bug in OpenSSL <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8756>`__ which should be fixed in
a future release.
