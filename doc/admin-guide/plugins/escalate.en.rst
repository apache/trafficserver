The Escalate plugin allows Traffic Server to try an alternate
origin when the origin server in the remap rule is either unavailable
or returns specific HTTP error codes. Some services call this failover
or fail-action.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The escalate plugin is a remap plugin (not global) and takes a parameter
with two delimitated fields: ``comma-separated-error-codes:secondary-origin-server``.  For instance,

    ``@pparam=401,404,410,502:second-origin.example.com``

would have Traffic Server send a cache miss to ``second-origin.example.com``
when the origin server in the remap rule returns a 401,
404, 410, or 502 error code.

@pparam=--pristine
  This option sends the "pristine" Host: header (eg, the Host: header
  that the client sent) to the escalated request.

Installation
------------

This plugin is considered stable and is included with |TS| by default. There
are no special steps necessary for its installation.

Example
-------

With this line in :file:`remap.config` ::

    map cdn.example.com origin.example.com \
      @plugin=escalate.so @pparam=401,404,410,502:second-origin.example.com @pparam=--pristine

Traffic Server would accept a request for ``cdn.example.com`` and, on a cache miss, proxy the
request to ``origin.example.com``. If the response code from that server is a 401, 404, 410,
or 502, then Traffic Server would proxy the request to ``second-origin.example.com``, using a
Host: header of ``cdn.example.com``.
