FQ Pacing Plugin
==================

This is a remap plugin  that allows ATS to rate limit an individual TCP connection. It is based on
Linux support for the Fair Queuing qdisc. FQ and SO_MAX_PACING_RATE is available in RedHat/Centos 7.2+,
Debian 8+, and any other Linux distro with a kernel 3.18 or greater.


How it Works
------------
When activated during remap processing, this plugin calls ``setsockopt(SO_MAX_PACING_RATE)`` on the
client socket. To prevent the rate from leaking to other remap rules the client may access in future
requests, a hook is set to deactivate the pacing when the current transaction completes. 


Installation
------------
First, enable the FQ qdisc by setting ``net.core.default_qdisc=fq`` in ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` and rebooting.

The `FQ Pacing` plugin is a :term:`remap plugin`.  Enable it by adding
``fq_pacing.so`` to your :file:`remap.config` file.  Provide a ``--rate=BytesPerSec`` option to set
the maxmimum rate of a TCP connection matching that remap line.

Here is an example remap.config entry:

::

  map http://reverse-fqdn.com http://origin.com @plugin=fq_pacing.so @pparam=--rate=100000
