Stats Over HTTP Plugin
**********************

This plugin implements an HTTP interface to all Traffic Server statistics. The
metrics returned are in a JSON format, for easy processing. This plugin is now
part of the standard ATS build process, and should be available after install.

Enabling Stats Over HTTP
========================

To enable this plugin, add to the :file:`plugin.config` file::

    stats_over_http.so

After starting Traffic Server, the JSON metrics are now available on the
default URL::

    http://host:port/_stats

where host and port is the hostname/IP and port number of the server.

Plugin Options
==============

.. option:: --integer-counters

This option causes the plugin to emit floating point and integral
metric values as JSON numbers, rather then JSON strings. This can
cause interoperability problems since integer metrics have a 64-bit
unsigned range.

.. option:: --wrap-counters

This option wraps 64-bit unsigned values to the 64-bit signed range.
This aids interoperability with Java, since prior to the Java SE 8
release, Java did not have a 64-bit unsigned type.

You can optionally modify the path to use, and this is highly
recommended in a public facing server. For example::

    stats_over_http.so 81c075bc0cca1435ea899ba4ad72766b

and the URL would then be e.g.::

    https://host:port/81c075bc0cca1435ea899ba4ad72766b

This is weak security at best, since the secret could possibly leak if you are
careless and send it over clear text.

Config File Usage
=================

stats_over_http.so also accepts a configuration file taken as a parameter

The plugin first checks if the parameter that was passed in is a file that exists, if so
it uses that as a config file, otherwise if a parameter exists it assumes that it is meant
to be used a path value (as if you were not using a config file)

You can add comments to the config file, starting with a `#` value

Other options you can specify:

.. option:: path=

This sets the path value for stats

.. option:: allow_ip=

A comma separated white list of ipv4 addresses allowed to accesss the endpoint

.. option:: allow_ip6=

A comma separated white list of ipv6 addresses allowed to access the endpoint
