.. _admin-jsonrpc-description:

Description
===========

|TS| Implements and exposes management calls using a JSONRPC API.  This API is base on the following two things:

* `JSON  <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_  format. Lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
  It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It's basically a  collection of name/value pairs.

* `JSONRPC 2.0 <https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ protocol. Stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.
  Primarily this specification defines several data structures and the rules around their processing.


In order for programs to communicate with |TS|, the server exposes a ``JSONRRPC 2.0`` API where programs can communicate with it.




.. _admnin-jsonrpc-configuration:

Configuration
=============

The |RPC| server can be configured using the following configuration file.


.. note::

   |TS| will start the |RPC| server without any need for configuration.


If a non-default configuration is needed, the following describes the structure.


File `jsonrpc.yaml` is a YAML format. The default configuration is::


   #YAML
   rpc:
      enabled: true
      unix:
         lock_path_name: /tmp/conf_jsonrpc.lock
         sock_path_name: /tmp/conf_jsonrpc.sock
         backlog: 5
         max_retry_on_transient_errors: 64


===================== =========================================================================================
Field Name            Description
===================== =========================================================================================
``enabled``           Enable/disable toggle for the whole implementation, server will not start if this is false/no
``unix``              Specific definitions as per transport.
===================== =========================================================================================


IPC Socket (``unix``):

===================================== =========================================================================================
Field Name                            Description
===================================== =========================================================================================
``lock_path_name``                    Lock path, including the file name. (changing this may have impacts in :program:`traffic_ctl`)
``sock_path_name``                    Sock path, including the file name. This will be used as ``sockaddr_un.sun_path``. (changing this may have impacts in :program:`traffic_ctl`)
``backlog``                           Check https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html
``max_retry_on_transient_errors``     Number of times the implementation is allowed to retry when a transient error is encountered.
===================================== =========================================================================================


.. note::

   Currently, there is only 1 communication mechanism supported. Unix Domain Sockets
