Configure Traffic Server
========================

You can quickly and easily change your Traffic
Server configuration via command-line interface using :program:`traffic_ctl`.

View Configuration Options
--------------------------

To view a configuration setting, enter the following command::

    traffic_ctl config get VARIABLE

where *var* is the variable associated with the configuration
option. For a list of variables, refer to :ref:`configuration-variables`.

Change Configuration Options
----------------------------

To change the value of a configuration setting, enter the following
command::

    traffic_ctl config set VARIABLE VALUE

where *var* is the variable associated with the configuration option
and *value* is the value you want to use. For a list of the
variables, see :ref:`configuration-variables`.

Configure Traffic Server Using Configuration Files
==================================================

You can change
Traffic Server configuration options by manually editing specific
variables in :file:`records.config`.

Traffic Server must reread the configuration files for any changes to take effect.
This is done with :option:`traffic_ctl config reload`. Some configuration changes require a
full restart of Traffic Server.

The following is a sample portion of :file:`records.config`:

   Sample records.config file

In addition to :file:`records.config`,
Traffic Server provides other configuration files that are used to
configure specific features. You can manually edit all configuration
files as described in :ref:`admin-configuration-files`.
