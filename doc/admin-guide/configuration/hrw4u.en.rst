HRW4U DSL
*********

HRW4U is a next-generation rule language for the existing ATS
:ref:`admin-plugins-header-rewrite` plugin. It introduces clearer
syntax, formal grammar, full condition nesting, semantic validation,
and extensible condition/operator support.

Overview
========

HRW4U replaces the free-form text parsing of ``header_rewrite`` with a formally defined
grammar using ANTLR. This makes HRW4U easier to parse, validate, and extend.

Rather than repeating ``header_rewrite`` documentation, please refer to:
  - :ref:`admin-plugins-header-rewrite` for feature behavior and semantics
  - This page focuses on syntax and behavior *differences* in HRW4U

Why HRW4U?
----------

Over time, the ``header_rewrite`` format has become unwieldy and difficult to use.
HRW4U aims to improve the following:

- Structured grammar and parser
- Better error diagnostics (line/col, filename, hints)
- Proper nested condition support using `if (...)` and `{ ... }` blocks
- Symbol tables for variable declarations and usage
- Static validation of operand types and value ranges
- Explicit `VARS` declarations with typed variables (`bool`, `int8`, `int16`)
- Optional debug output to trace logic evaluation

Building
--------

Currently, the HRW4U compiler is not built as part of the ATS build process. You need to
build it separately using Python 3.10+ and pyenv environments. There's a ``bootstrap.sh``
script in the ``tools/hrw4u`` directory that helps with the setup process.

Once set up, simply run:

.. code-block:: none

   make
   make package

This will produce a PIP package in the ``dist`` directory. You can install it in a
virtualenv or system-wide using:

.. code-block:: none

   pipx install dist/hrw4u-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

Using
-----

Once installed, you will have a ``hrw4u`` command available. You can run it as
follows to produce the help output:

.. code-block:: none

   hrw4u --help

Doing a compile is simply:

.. code-block:: none

   hrw4u some_file.hrw4u

Syntax Differences
==================

The basic structure is a `section` name defining the part of the transaction to run in
followed by conditionals and operators. It uses `if () {} else {}` conditional syntax
with `&& , || and ==`, with conditions and operators generally following function() or
object.style grammar. Operator lines are terminated with `;` (whitespace is still not
significant). For instance:

.. code-block:: none

   VARS {
     Foo: bool;
     Bar: int8;
   }

   REMAP {
     if inbound.status == 403 || access("/etc/lock") {
       inbound.req.X-Fail = "1";
     } else {
       no-op();
     }
   }

There is no `cond` or `set-header` syntax â€” those are implied by context.


Condition & Operator Mapping
============================

Key Differences from header_rewrite
-----------------------------------

==================== ============================= =========================================
Feature              header_rewrite                HRW4U
==================== ============================= =========================================
Context              Context sensitive             Explicit, e.g. ``inbound`` and ``outbound``
Syntax               Free-form                     Structured `if (...) { ... }`
Conditions           `cond %{...}`                 Implicit in `if (...)`
Operators            Raw text (`set-header`)       Structured assignments or statements
Grouping             `GROUP` / `GROUP:END`         Use `()` inside `if` expressions
Else branches        `else` with indented ops      `else { ... }` with full block
Debugging            Manual with logs              Built-in debug tracing (`--debug`)
Quotes               Quoted strings optional       Quoted strings required / encouraged
Validation           Runtime                       Static during parsing and symbol resolution
==================== ============================= =========================================

.. note::
    The logical operator precedence is the same as in `header_rewrite`: which is left to right!
    This differs from most programming languages where `&&` has higher precedence than `||`.
    The implication being that you may have to use parentheses to get the desired precedence.

Conditions
----------

Below is a partial mapping of `header_rewrite` condition symbols to their HRW4U equivalents:

=============================== ================================== ================================================
Header Rewrite                   HRW4U                             Description

cond %{METHOD} =GET             inbound.method == "GET"            HTTP method match
cond %{NEXT-HOP:<C>} ="bar"     outbound.url.<C> == "bar"          Next-hop URL component match, <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-url-parts>`> is ``host`` etc.

cond %{TO-URL:<C>} =bar         to.url.<C> == "bar"                Remap ``To URL`` component match, <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-url-parts>`> is ``host`` etc.
cond %{TXN-COUNT} >10           txn-count() > 10                   Number of transactions on client connection
cond %{URL:<C> =bar             {in,out}bound.url.<C> == "bar"     Context aware URL component match
cond %{GEO:<C>} =bar            geo.<C> == "bar"                   IP to Geo mapping. <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-geo>`> is country, asn, etc.
cond %{STATUS} =200             inbound.status ==200               Origin http status code
cond %{TCP-INFO}                tcp.info                           TCP Info struct field values
cond %{HTTP-CNTL:<C>}           http.cntl.<C>                      Check the state of the <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-set-http-cntl>`> HTTP control
cond %{INBOUND:<C>}             {in,out}bound.conn.<c>             inbound (:ref:`client, user agent<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-inbound>`) connection to ATS
=============================== ================================== ================================================

The conditions operating on headers and URLs are also available as operators. E.g.:

.. code-block:: none

   if inbound.req.X == "foo" {
     inbound.req.X = "bar";
   }

In general, where it makes sense for the condition to be used as an operator, it is available as an operator.
The rule of thumb is the conditional is an operator if the value is mutable.

.. note::
    Each parenthesis group in a conditional will produce a GROUP. Thus, the original header_rewrite
    config will be more readable with ``if ...`` than `if (...)`.

Operators
---------

Operators in ``header_rewrite`` map to HRW4U as a mix of assignments and function calls.
The preference is the assignment style when appropriate.

============================= ================================= ================================================
Header Rewrite                HRW4U                             Description

rm-destination <C>            inbound.url.<C> = ""              Remove an URL component, ``C`` is path, query etc.
rm-header X-Foo               {in,out}bound.req.X-Foo = ""      Context sensitive header removal
rm-destination QUERY ...      remove_query("foo,bar")           Remove specified query keys
rm-destination QUERY ... [I]  keep_query("foo,bar")             Keep only specified query keys
run-plugin foo.so "args"      run-plugin("foo.so", "arg1", ...) Run an external remap plugin
set-body "foo"                inbound.resp.body = "foo"         Set the response body
set-body-from "\https://..."   set-body-from("\https://...")      Set the response body from a URL
set-config <name> 12          set-config("name", 17)            Set a configuration variable to a value

set-conn-mark 17              inbound.conn.mark = 17            Set the MARK value for the connection
set-cookie foo bar            {in,out}bound.cookie.foo = "bar"  Set a request/response cookie named foo
set-destination <C> bar       inbound.url.<C> = "bar"           Set a URL component, <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-url-parts>`> is path, query etc.
set-header X-Bar foo          inbound.{req,resp}.X-Bar = "foo"  Assign a client request/origin response header
set-redirect <Code> <URL>     set-redirect(302, "\https://...")  Set a redirect response
set-status 404                http.status = 404                 Set the response status code
set-status-reason "No"        http.status.reason = "no"         Set the response status reason
set-http-cntl                 http.cntl.<C> = bool              Turn on/off <:ref:`C<admin-plugins-header-rewrite-set-http-cntl>`> controllers
============================= ================================= ================================================

In addition to those operators above, HRW4U supports the following special operators without arguments:

================= ============================ ================================
Header Rewrite    HRW4U Syntax                 Description
================= ============================ ================================
no-op             no-op();                     Explicit no-op statement
set-debug         set-debug()                  Enables ATS txn debug
skip-remap        skip-remap()                 Skip remap processing (open proxy)
================= ============================ ================================

String concatenations
---------------------

You can concatenate values using strings, condition values, and variable expansions
on the same line in operators. For instance, ``outbound.req.CustomHeader = "Hello from {inbound.ip}:{inbound.port}"``.
As a result, the set-redirect's ``[QSA]`` flag would be implemented as
``set-redirect(302, "https://...?{inbound.url.query}")``.
Note the presence of the ``?`` -- the url.query doesn't include it.


Semantics
=========

Sections
--------

All HRW4U sections start with a label such as `REMAP`, `READ_RESPONSE`, etc. These map
directly to `header_rewrite` hook conditions:

=============================== ======================== ================================
Header Rewrite Hook             HRW4U Section Name       Description
=============================== ======================== ================================
TXN_START_HOOK                  TXN_START                Start of transaction
READ_REQUEST_PRE_REMAP_HOOK     PRE_REMAP                Before remap processing
REMAP_PSEUDO_HOOK               REMAP                    Default remap hook
READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK           READ_REQUEST             After reading request from client
SEND_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK           SEND_REQUEST             Before contacting origin
READ_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK          READ_RESPONSE            After receiving response from origin
SEND_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK          SEND_RESPONSE            Before sending response to client
TXN_CLOSE_HOOK                  TXN_CLOSE                End of transaction
=============================== ======================== ================================

A special section `VARS` is used to declare variables. There is no equivalent in
`header_rewrite`, where you managed the variables manually.

.. note::
    The section name is always required in HRW4U, there are no implicit or default hooks. There
    can be several if/else block per section block.

Groups
------

`header_rewrite` uses `GROUP` and `GROUP:END`, whereas HRW4U uses `(...)` expressions:

.. code-block:: none

   # header_rewrite
   cond %{GROUP}
     cond A [AND]
     cond B
   cond %{GROUP:END}

   # HRW4U
   if (A && B) {
     ...
   }

Condition operators
-------------------

HRW4U supports the following condition operators, which are used in `if (...)` expressions:

==================== ========================= ============================================
Operator             HRW4U Syntax              Description
==================== ========================= ============================================
==                   foo == "bar"              String or numeric equality
!=                   foo != "bar"              String or numeric inequality
>                    foo > 100                 Numeric greater than
<                    foo < 100                 Numeric less than
~                    foo ~ /pattern/           Regular expression match
!~                   foo !~ /pattern/          Regular expression non-match
in [...]             foo in ["a", "b"]         Membership in a list of values
==================== ========================= ============================================

Modifiers
---------

HRW4U supports the following modifiers for the string conditions:

============= ===============================================
Modifier      Description
============= ===============================================
EXT           Match  extension after last dot (e.g. in a path)
MID           Match substring
SUF           Match the end of a string
PRE           Match the beginning of a string
NOCASE        Case insensitive match
============= ===============================================

These can be used with both sets and equality checks, using the ``with`` keyword:

.. code-block:: none

   if inbound.req.X == "foo" with MID,NOCASE {
     ...
   }

   if inbound.url.path in ["mp3", "mp4"] with EXT,NOCASE {
     ...
   }

Running and Debugging
=====================

To run HRW4U, just install and run the hrw4u compiler:

.. code-block:: none

   hrw4u /path/to/rules.hrw4u

Run with `--debug all` to trace:

- Lexer, parser, visitor behavior
- Condition evaluations
- State and output emission

Examples
========

The examples section in :doc:`Header Rewrite <../plugins/header_rewrite.en>` are translated below
into HRW4U with their original descriptions. These are also part of the testing suite.

Remove Origin Authentication Headers
------------------------------------

The following ruleset removes any authentication headers from the origin
response before caching it or returning it to the client. This is accomplished
by setting the hook context and then removing the cookie and basic
authentication headers.::

   READ_RESPONSE {
       outbound.resp.Set-Cookie = "";
       outbound.resp.WWW-Authenticate = "";
   }

Count Teapots
-------------

Maintains a counter statistic, which is incremented every time an origin server
has decided to be funny by returning HTTP 418::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       if outbound.status == 418 {
           counter("plugin.header_rewrite.teapots");
       }
   }

Normalize Statuses
------------------

For client-facing purposes only (because we set the hook context to just prior
to delivering the response back to the client, but after all processing and
possible cache updates have occurred), replaces all 4xx HTTP status codes from
the origin server with ``404``::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       if inbound.status > 399 && inbound.status < 500 {
           inbound.status = 404;
       }
   }

Remove Cache Control to Origins
-------------------------------

Removes cache control related headers from requests before sending them to an
origin server::

   SEND_REQUEST {
      outbound.req.Cache-Control = "";
      outbound.req.Pragma = "";
   }

Enable Debugging Per-Request
----------------------------

Turns on |TS| debugging statements for a transaction, but only when a special
header is present in the client request::

   READ_REQUEST {
      if inbound.req.X-Debug == "supersekret" {
          set-debug();
      }
   }

Remove Internal Headers
-----------------------

Removes special internal/development headers from origin responses, unless the
client request included a special debug header::

   READ_RESPONSE {
      if inbound.req.X-Debug != "keep" {
          outbound.resp.X-Debug-Foo = "";
          outbound.resp.X-Debug-Bar = "";
      }
   }

Return Original Method in Response Header
-----------------------------------------

This rule copies the original HTTP method that was used by the client into a
custom response header::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       inbound.resp.X-Original-Method = "{inbound.method}";
   }

Useless Example From Purpose
----------------------------

Even that useless example from Purpose in the beginning of this document is
possible to accomplish::

   READ_RESPONSE {
       if inbound.url.port == 8090 && inbound.method == "HEAD" &&
         inbound.req.Accept-Language !~ /es-py/ && outbound.status == 304 ||
         random(500) > 200 {
       outbound.status = 403;
       }
   }

Add Cache Control Headers Based on Origin Path
----------------------------------------------

This rule adds cache control headers to CDN responses based on matching the origin
path. One provides a max age and the other provides a "no-cache" statement to
two different file paths. ::

   READ_RESPONSE {
      if inbound.url.path ~ /examplepath1/ {
          outbound.resp.Cache-Control = "max-age=3600";
          break;
      }
   }

   READ_RESPONSE {
      if inbound.url.path ~ /examplepath2\/examplepath3\/.*/ {
          outbound.resp.Cache-Control = "no-cache";
          break;
      }
   }

Redirect when the Origin Server Times Out
-----------------------------------------

This rule sends a 302 redirect to the client with the requested URI's Path and
Query string when the Origin server times out or the connection is refused::

   TBD

Check for existence of a header
-------------------------------

This rule will modify the ``Cache-Control`` header, but only if it is not
already set to some value, and the status code is a 2xx::

   READ_RESPONSE {
      if outbound.resp.Cache-Control == "" && outbound.status > 199 && outbound.status < 300 {
          outbound.resp.Cache-Control = "max-age=600, public";
       }
   }

Add HSTS
--------

Add the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header if it does not exist and the inbound connection is TLS::

   READ_RESPONSE {
      if outbound.resp.Strict-Transport-Security == "" && inbound.conn.TLS != "" {
          outbound.resp.Strict-Transport-Security  = "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload";
      }
   }

This is mostly used by being attached to a remap rule that maps to a host known to support TLS. If
the parallel `OUTBOUND` supported is added then this could be done by checking for inbound TLS both
outbound TLS in the `SEND_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK`. However this technique may be used for a non-TLS
upstream if the goal is to require the user agent to connect to |TS| over TLS.

Close Connections for draining
------------------------------

When a healthcheck file is missing (in this example, ``/path/to/the/healthcheck/file.txt``),
add a ``Connection: close`` header to have clients drop their connection,
allowing the server to drain. Although the Connection header is only available on
HTTP/1.1 in terms of protocols, this also works for HTTP/2 connections
because the header triggers HTTP/2 graceful shutdown. This should be a global
configuration.::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
      if !access("/path/to/the/healthcheck/file.txt") {
          inbound.resp.Connection = "close";
      }
   }

Use Internal header to pass data
--------------------------------

In |TS|, a header that begins with ``@`` does not leave |TS|. Thus, you can use
this to pass data to different |TS| systems. For instance, a series of remap rules
could each be tagged with a consistent name to make finding logs easier.::

   REMAP {
       inbound.req.@PropertyName = "someproperty";
   }

(Then in :file:`logging.yaml`, log ``%<{@PropertyName}cqh>``)

.. note::
    Remember using the variables in ``HRW4u`` can often be more efficient than using
    these internal headers.

Remove Client Query Parameters
------------------------------------

The following ruleset removes any query parameters set by the client.::

   REMAP {
       inbound.url.query = "";
   }

Remove only a few select query parameters::

   REMAP {
       remove_query("foo,bar");
   }

Keep only a few select query parameters -- removing the rest::

   REMAP {
       keep_query("foo,bar");
   }

Mimic X-Debug Plugin's X-Cache Header
-------------------------------------

This rule can mimic X-Debug plugin's ``X-Cache`` header by accumulating
the ``CACHE`` condition results to a header.::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       if inbound.resp.All-Cache != "" {
           inbound.resp.All-Cache = "{inbound.resp.All-Cache}, {cache()}";
       }
       if inbound.resp.All-Cache == "" {
           inbound.resp.All-Cache = "{cache()}";
       }
   }

And finally, a  much more efficient solution, using the ``else`` clause.::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       if inbound.resp.All-Cache == "" {
           inbound.resp.All-Cache = "{cache()}";
       } else {
           inbound.resp.All-Cache = "{inbound.resp.All-Cache}, {cache()}";
       }
   }

Add Identifier from Server with Data
------------------------------------

This rule adds a unique identifier from the server if the data is fresh from
the cache or if the identifier has not been generated yet. This will inform
the client where the requested data was served from.::

   SEND_RESPONSE {
       if inbound.resp.ATS-SRVR-UUID == "" || cache() == "hit-fresh" {
           inbound.resp.ATS-SRVR-UUID = "{id(UNIQUE)}";
       }
   }

Apply rate limiting for some select requests
--------------------------------------------

This rule will conditionally, based on the client request headers, apply rate
limiting to the request.::

   REMAP {
       if inbound.req.Some-Special-Header == "yes" {
           run-plugin("rate_limit.so", "--limit=300", "--error=429");
       }
   }
