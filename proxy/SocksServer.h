  For supporting multiple Socks servers, we essentially use the

  If needed, we will have to implement most of the functions in
  ParentSection.cc for Socks as well. For right now we will just use
  ParentSelection

  All the members in ParentConfig are static. Right now
  we will duplicate the code for these static functions.
