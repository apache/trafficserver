/**
 * @brief loads plugins, instantiates and keep track of plugin instances created by this factory.
 *
 * - Handles looking through search directories to determine final plugin canonical file name to be used (called here effective
 * path).
 * - Makes sure we load each DSO only once per effective path.
 * - Keeps track of all loaded remap plugins and their instances.
 * - Maitains the notion of plugin runtime paths and makes sure every factory instance uses different runtime paths for its plugins.
 * - Makes sure plugin DSOs are loaded for the lifetime of the PluginFactory.
 *
 * Each plugin factory instance corresponds to a config reload, each new config file set is meant to use a new factory instance.
 * A notion of runtime directory is maintained to make sure the DSO library files are not erased or modified while the library are
 * loaded in memory and make sure if the library file is overriden with a new DSO file that the new overriding plugin's
 * functionality will be loaded with the next factory, it also handles some problems noticed on different OSes in handling
 * filesystem links and different dl library implementations.
 *
 * @note This is meant to unify the way global and remap plugins are (re)loaded (global plugin support is not implemented yet).
