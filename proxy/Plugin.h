/** Abstract interface class for plugin based continuations.

    The primary intended use of this is for logging so that continuations
    that generate logging messages can generate plugin local data in a
    generic way.

    The core will at appropriate times dynamically cast the continuation
    to this class and if successful access the plugin data via these
    methods.

    Plugins should mix this in to continuations for which it is useful.
    The default implementations return empty / invalid responses and should
    be overridden by the plugin.
