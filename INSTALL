APACHE TRAFFIC SERVER UNIX QUICKSTART
-------------------------------------

For complete installation documentation, see the on-line documentation at

    https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/


Various popular platforms have up-to-date build instructions available
online, at

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Building


BUILD AND INSTALLATION
----------------------

On Linux, macOS and FreeBSD:
    $ cmake -B build [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX]
    $ cmake --build build

To install:
    $ sudo cmake --install build

* Building on FreeBSD requires GNU make. This is the preferred make
  on all platforms.

* Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which Traffic Server
  should be installed.  Default PREFIX is "/usr/local" (without the
  quotes).

* If you want to build using different layout see the config.layout
  file for possible alternatives. You can create your own layout
  and enable it with ./configure --enable-layout=ID, where ID is
  the layout name you have created.

* The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags
  for Traffic Server is to run `ccmake build`


By default the build will use the highest level of compiler
optimization. To alter this, specify the Release build type:

    $ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

To compile with an alternate set of compilers, e.g. LLVM/Clang

    $ cmake -B build CC=clang CXX=clang++


To start the Traffic Server process stack (TC, TM, TS):
    $ sudo PREFIX/bin/trafficserver start
