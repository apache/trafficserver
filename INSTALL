APACHE TRAFFIC SERVER UNIX QUICKSTART
-------------------------------------

For complete installation documentation, see the on-line documentation at

    https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/


Various popular platforms have up-to-date build instructions available
online, at

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Building


BUILD AND INSTALLATION
----------------------

On Linux, macOS and FreeBSD:
    $ cmake -B build [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX]
    $ cmake --build build

To install:
    $ sudo cmake --install build

* Building on FreeBSD requires GNU make. This is the preferred make
  on all platforms.

* Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which Traffic Server
  should be installed.  Default PREFIX is "/usr/local" (without the
  quotes).

* If you want to build using different layout see the config.layout
  file for possible alternatives. You can create your own layout
  and enable it with ./configure --enable-layout=ID, where ID is
  the layout name you have created.

* The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags
  for Traffic Server is to run `ccmake build`

* For convience, if there a file named "CMakeLists.nice" in the source
  directory, it will be loaded early in the loading of "CMakeList.txt".
  This enables local modifications that don't have to be passed on the
  command line or IDE. For instance if this is put in that file then
  the install directory will be set to "/opt/ts".

    set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/opt/ts")


By default the build will use the highest level of compiler
optimization. To alter this, specify the Release build type:

    $ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

To compile with an alternate set of compilers, e.g. LLVM/Clang

    $ cmake -B build CC=clang CXX=clang++


To start the Traffic Server process stack (TC, TM, TS):
    $ sudo PREFIX/bin/trafficserver start
