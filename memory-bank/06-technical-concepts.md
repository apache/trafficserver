# Apache Traffic Server - Technical Concepts

## Key Technical Concepts

### Event System
- Non-blocking, event-driven architecture
- Continuation-based programming model
- Thread pools for different event types
- Asynchronous processing throughout the system

### Cache Architecture
- Multi-tier caching (RAM + disk)
- Sophisticated cache algorithms
- Cache partitioning and management
- Configurable cache policies and storage

### Plugin Architecture
- Hook-based plugin system
- Multiple plugin types (remap, global, etc.)
- C++ and Lua plugin support
- Event-driven plugin execution

### Network Stack
- Asynchronous I/O
- Connection multiplexing
- Protocol-agnostic design
- Support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3

### Threading Model
- Event-driven, multi-threaded architecture
- Separate thread pools for different operations
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Efficient CPU utilization

### Memory Management
- Custom memory allocators (jemalloc/mimalloc support)
- Memory pools for frequent allocations
- RAII principles throughout C++ codebase
- Memory leak detection and prevention

### Configuration System
- YAML-based configuration files
- Runtime configuration changes via JSONRPC
- Hot reloading capabilities
- Schema validation for configuration files

### Logging and Statistics
- High-performance logging system
- Comprehensive statistics collection
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Flexible log formats and destinations

### Security Features
- TLS/SSL termination and passthrough
- Certificate management
- Access control and authentication
- Security headers and policies

### Performance Optimizations
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Efficient buffer management
- Connection pooling and reuse
- CPU cache-friendly data structures
