The `escape_mapper` tool is a simple utility that allows one to view
the existing table used for URL escaping, found in LogUtils, specifically
the escapify_url_common function. This function allows one to specify
an alternate table that contains more characters to escape than the
RFC-compliant default.

WARNING: the default encoded characters list is currently hardcoded.

This tool operates in two basic modes:
  1) print out the default mappings
  2) print out the new mapping based on the provided argument

Only one argument is supported to generate a new mapping table, for example:
	./escape_mapper '&,+/='
