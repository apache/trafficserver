Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.7
  *) [TS-710] Do not dlopen / reload a remap plugin .so more than once.

  *) [TS-588] Change Remap plugin APIs to use URL TSMLoc, and normal
   ts/ts.h APIs for getting and setting components.

  *) [TS-708] TsConfig doesn't handle backslashes correctly.

  *) [TS-209] add support for raw disk on Solaris: credits: Igor Brezac
    for both the code and testing!

  *) [TS-705] Fixes for compiling with gcc v4.6.

  *) [TS-706] hardware sector size's over 8K current report an Error
   but are passed through resulting in lots of disk waste.

  *) [TS-707] The random number generator from 1-23-2011 is using the
   same seed for all threads = collisions in the cache

  *) [TS-700] Need additional controls in cache.config.

  *) [TS-696] make check fails on libtsutil due to missing libresolv
   and librt. Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-691] LogFilter not working for "int" types.
   Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-692] Add an experimental API to modify the outgoing IP address.

  *) TS-676: logic in Store::clear and Store::read_config is wrong.
  Author: mohan_zl.

  *) [TS-680] Change many typedef void* types to anonymous structs.

  *) [TS-690] Schedule some callbacks on the ET_TASK threads

  *) TS-689 Restore TSMgmtUpdateRegister() to the SDK APIs.

  *) [TS-550] Remove MgmtPlugin.{cc,h}.

  *) [TS-657] Proper validation of RWW settings on startup.

  *) [TS-688] Remove the "tag" modifier from parent.config.

  *) [TS-682] Segfault when partition.config is used.

  *) [TS-687] Build failures on FreeBSD8

  *) [TS-684] config.layout for gentoo linux, may also be used on Fedora

  *) [TS-675] Make redirect and reverse maps work again.


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.6

  *) [TS-678] Add a config option for try-lock retry delay.
    
   This adds a configuration option
    
         proxy.config.cache.mutex_retry_delay INT 2
    
   2ms seems to be fairly optimal, with little detrimental effect on CPU
   usage. We'll fine tune this further in the next release.

  *) [TS-674] Fixes for cache.config and the "modifiers" to work.

  *) [TS-641] Remove inktomi*.css and some files only referenced by it.
   Removing mgmt/html2/charting. Remove the now empty mgmt/html2/tune.

  *) [TS-590] Cleanup all SDK APIs to be more consistent. This changes a
   large number of APIs, so please check updated docs and signatures in
   ts/ts.h. A new tools, tools/apichecker.pl, can be used to help
   identifying areas in existing plugins that might need changes.

  *) [TS-673] Make the default configurations more conservative
   for when content is cacheable.

  *) [TS-672] Remove unused/unreferenced Win32 header files and
   code paths

  *) [TS-671] Detect install group based on install user.

  *) [TS-644] Fix clustered cache pages crash.

  *) [TS-651] Clear all stats when we ask to clear the local stats.

  *) [TS-489] Remove the "connection collapsing" feature, it was poorly
   implemented, and caused major problem if enabled. We should redo this
   for v3.1 in a way that fits with the HttpSM [author: mohan_zl].

  *) [TS-668] Add support for URL stats to traffic_logstats.

  *) [TS-665] Remove HTTP_ASSERT from the code base, use standard asserts.

  *) [TS-663, TS-664] Fixes to WCCP with mask assignments, and trunk build
   problems.

  *) [TS-662] Make per partition stats for bytes_used work.

  *) [TS-661] Delay the copy of per transaction configs until a plugin
   actually tries to modify a setting. We also add these settings to the
   list of configurations that is overridable:

       proxy.config.http.cache.max_open_read_retries
       proxy.config.http.cache.open_read_retry_time

  *) [TS-660] Cache scan can not be canceled.

  *) [TS-505, TS-506] Changed the defaults to deal with read contention on
   the cache, this dramatically improves the performance on cache misses.

  *) [TS-655] Reorganize some code to reduce binary foot prints.

  *) [TS-653] Bogus logcat conversion of squid timestamps.

  *) [TS-643] Unable to purge objects on other servers in full cluster mode.

  *) New 64-bit random generator.

  *) [TS-639] Rename the management APIs from INK* to TS*.

  *) [TS-650] Remove the dead v2 stats code.

  *) [TS-649] Dynamic libraries for mgmt APIs.
    
    This makes libts -> libtsutil, and we now support making .so's for
    libtsutil.so and libtsmgmt.so. All binaries are changed to use this,
    except traffic_server which continues to use the libtsutil.a library
    (for performance on e.g. 32-bit platforms).
    
    This also renames the public API include file to be
    
         #include <ts/mgmtapi.h>


  *) [TS-647] Move Layout out of iocore and into lib/ts.

  *) [TS-638] Rename various directories:
      proxy/mgmt -> mgmt/
      proxy/mgmt/cop -> cop/

   All "cli" APIs are now also migrated into mgmt/cli, unified into one
   single cli.

  *) [TS-641] Cleanup of Web2/HTML2.

  *) [TS-636, TS-637] Remove various unused source files.

  *) [TS-631] Rename proxy/http2 -> proxy/http and proxy/mgmt2 to proxy/mgmt.

  *) [TS-582] Add an example to records.config for how to bind a specific IP.

  *) [TS-491] Cluster port was activated even with clustering disabled. This fix also
   adds monitoring support for the "cli" unix domain socket.

  *) [TS-593] Cleanup of inktomi.com.

  *) [TS-324] Cleaning up some old TCL files and dependencies.

  *) Remove traces of FTP references [TS-324] by purging the now useless TCL
  bindings to it.

  *) [TS-513] Fix configure issues for sqlite3. This fix eliminates all of
  SimpleDBM, sqlite3 and bdb dependencies. It also fixes the "make
  distclean" problem, and clean things up a bit.

  *) [TS-491] Add the CLI interface to Traffic Cop, and make it possible to
   run traffic_manager without listening on the cluster port.

  *) [TS-583] Build fails if --disable-webui is added.

  *) [TS-618] Removing traces of CCAS/CCASFLAGS.

  *) [TS-627] Fixes for "make check" to succeed (author: Arno Toell). 

  *) [TS-632] Fixes for bad cast and cleanup for Intel CC.


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.5

  *) More 64-bit issues has been identified in the SDK and HTTP core, and
  fixed [TS-620].

  *) Code cleanup of old transparency code and options [TS-613].

  *) We now require a compiler (or libc) that provides atomic
  operations. This includes gcc 4.1.2 or later, Intel CC, clang (recent
  versions) as well as Sun's Solaris compilers and libc [TS-618].

  *) Support normal default path for remap plugins [TS-616].

  *) Change default settings for MSIE User-Agent sniffing [TS-615].

  *) Remove remnants from InktoSwitch. This removes the following
  configurations [TS-614]:

      proxy.config.http.inktoswitch_enabled
      proxy.config.http.router_ip
      proxy.config.http.router_port

  *) Modify TSContSchedule to take a thread type, and add
  TSContScheduleEvery [TS-589].

  *) Added support to allow some select (~50 or so) records.config
  configurations to be overridable per transaction. This is done via new SDK
  APIs, as well as a remap plugin provided with the core [TS-599]. The new
  APIs available are 

      TSHttpTxnConfigIntSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigIntGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFloatSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFloatGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigStringSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigStringGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFind()

  *) Eliminate dedicated default DNS for SplitDNS [TS-597]. Author: Zhao
   Yongming.

  *) Eliminate proxy.config.net.max_poll_delay configs [TS-605].

  *) Old traffic_net configurations are eliminated [TS-601]. 

  *) Multiple preads: this patch is only active if you call do_io_pread on
  the cache.  This includes a regression test for do_io_pread which is at
  least a smoke test of the new code. [TS-61]

  *) Migrate from home-grown regular expression classes to pcre [TS-604]
  
  *) Reduce number of calls to regex matcher for standard requests with
   well-known-strings (WKS). [TS-603]
  
  *) Parse Range: requests a bit better. Prior, a request like like Range:
   bytes=100-200 would return 0-200. Additionally, Range: bytes=100- would
   not parse properly. [TS-596]

  *) Remove old, unused configuration code (duplicated) [TS-576].

  *) Bump the SDK version numbers properly [TS-595].

  *) Migrate from our own int64 (et.al) to int64_t / stdint types. This also
   changes the SDK, so ts/ts.h users should now use int64_t etc. [TS-594].

  *)./configure will now tell us more about its defaults.

  *) Add better tests for eventfd, making sure sys/eventfd.h exists
   [TS-515].

  *) Stub / base implementation for the Task thread pool [TS-589].

  *) Cleanup of traffic_logstats, and also add support for JSON
   output. Several new options and query args added to select output format
   and data [TS-587].

  *) Add back support for using the default DNSHandler from DNS.cc This
   helps with SplitDNS [TS-580].

  *) Fixes for DNS to properly schedule and initialize [TS-570].

  *) Fix make check so it actually compiles [TS-586].

  *) Remove RAF pieces [TS-584].

  *) Replace the SDKAllocator with a ClassAllocator [TS-577].

     This reduces the amount of memory allocation for plugins, but requires
     that plugins now religiously release the handles that they are expected
     to release (i.e. no automatic gc is done for lazy developers).


  *) Fixes for getting the altinfo regression check to succeeds [TS-171].

  *) Fixes for some transform, and other, mismatches of int vs int64 in the
   new APIs and underlying cache [TS-456].

  *) Eliminate misguided string copies in the SDK [TS-579].

  *) Fix build of ts.h and tsxs when the .in files changes [TS-574].

  *) Move libinktomi++ and librecords to lib/ts and lib/records [TS-571].

  *) Add SDK API calls to directly get the elements of the running TS
   version [TS-568].

  *) Added WCCP support.

  *) Bring IPv6 functionality back to trunk, for incoming (client)
   connections [TS-18]. Original author: Tsunayoshi Egawa.

  *) Segfault with HTTPS, fixed by correctly initializing SSLNetVConnection
   being added to freelist [TS-559].

  *) The old logs.config custom log format is no longer supported. Only the
   XML custom logs are now supported. This eliminates the config

       proxy.config.log.xml_logs_config

   as well, since it's the only option for custom logs [TS-556].

  *) All log configurations (and stats) are renamed from log2.* to
   log.*. This is to avoid confusion, since Apache Traffic Server never had
   the old (obsolete) log system. There's now only one log system, log
   [TS-555].

  *) Many fixes and improvements on the Stats pages subsystem. This now
   properly supports (if configured) various internal URLs, like
   http://{net}, http://{hostdb} etc. [TS-554].

  *) The NewCacheVC is removed [TS-551].

  *) Support for the Alpha processor is eliminated [TS-552].

  *) A number of unecessary memory allocations are removed, improving
   performance under heavy load. [TS-550, TS-549]

  *) All streaming media (MIXT) configurations are now properly removed from
   code and default configs [TS-544].

  *) URL scheme was case sensitive in the cache key [TS-474].

  *) Fixes for broken API signatures, additions / modifications to the
   following API:

     TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnArgSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int arg_idx, void *arg);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnArgGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int arg_idx, void **argp);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnArgSet(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int arg_idx, void *arg);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnArgGet(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int arg_idx, void **argp);

     TSReturnCode TSHttpArgIndexReserve(const char* name, const char*
     description, int* arg_idx); TSReturnCode TSHttpArgIndexNameLookup(const
     char* name, int* arg_idx, const char** description); TSReturnCode
     TSHttpArgIndexLookup(int arg_idx, const char** name, const char**
     description);

     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnTransactionCount(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int* count);

   This was all combine into [TS-504], but also see [TS-503].

  *) Many fixes for broken regression tests!

  *) RNI is now completely cleaned out [TS-536].

  *) Fixes for SplitDNS (co-author: mohan_zl) [TS-435].

  *) HTTPS to origin servers, with Chunked responses, would hang [TS-540].

  *) Mismatched APIs using "unsigned char*" [TS-458].

  *) Rename / modify TSSetCacheUrl() API, the new prototype is

     TSReturnCode TSCacheUrlSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, const char *url, int
     length);

   If length == -1, then the API will calculate it using strlen() [TS-520].

  *) All public APIs, structs and defines are now prefixed with "TS" instead
   of the old "INK". There are two exceptions, for the deprecated INKStats*
   and INKCoupledStats* APIs [TS-521].

  *) The hooks around "remap" has been organized, and a new hook as been
   added (for post-remap). New / renamed hooks are

     TS_HTTP_PRE_REMAP_HOOK TS_HTTP_POST_REMAP_HOOK

   In addition, a new API was added, to allow a plugin to skip the remap
   phase completely:

     TSReturnCode TSSkipRemappingSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int flag);

   These fixes went in with [TS-529] and [TS-530].

  *) INKHttpTxnSetHttpRetStatus not honored when an API transaction is
   reenabled with INK_EVENT_HTTP_ERROR [TS-535].

  *) Various defines for version identification has been moved to the public
   ts/ts.h include file, e.g.

       #define TS_VERSION_STRING             "2.1.6-unstable"
       #define TS_VERSION_NUMBER              2001006
       #define TS_VERSION_MAJOR               2
       #define TS_VERSION_MINOR               1
       #define TS_VERSION_MICRO               6

   The intended use is for plugins to be able to verify available APIs at
   compile time (vs the existing runtime checks) [TS-534].

  *) Traffic Server should now build on ARM processors. Commit message is
   appropriately describing the situation with this CPU:

   This is a sad day of defeat.  Not my defeat, but more a collective human
   defeat.
    
   Question: "Chips fabricated today don't have 64bit atomic primitives?"
   Answer: "Be sad."
    
   The ARM box we're working on (armv5tejl) doesn't support any 64bit
   primitives.
    
   This means we need a method of using a global (yes, giant lock of death)
   to protect modifications of arbitrary 64bit integers in process space.
   We could make this less contentious by allocating pagesize/8 mutexs and
   then protecting an int64 based on its page offset.  Instead, I think we
   should mobilize to burn these architectures to the ground and use public
   embarrassment to fix future instruction sets. If another platform has
   this issue, we'll want to change the define to:

   TS_ARCHITECTURE_LACKS_64BIT_INSTRUCTIONS and turn on the global death
   lock based on that.
    
   This does not change performance on any other platform -- it's compile
   time capital punishment. [TS-533] and [TS-135].

  *) Very old APIs, that have been deprecated since long before the Apache
   Open Source project, are removed. Also, only three public include files
   are now available:

     ts/ts.h ts/experimental.h ts/remap.h

  Various other cleanup related to the APIs was also done [TS-522].


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.4

  *) Fixes to clustering, that caused an assert to trigger after the stats
   changes [TS-519].

  *) Make the checks when to honor the Content-Length: header less strict,
   against origins without Keep-Alive [TS-500].

  *) Eliminate old ssl_ports feature, it's completely replaced with the
   connect_ports configuration [TS-517].

  *) New script available to help build plugins, tsxs [TS-512].

  *) Simple, brute force (and efficient) status code stats counters
   [TS-509].

  *) Generalize RecDumpRecordsHt to use RecDumpRecords which is a
   callback/map pattern [TS-508].

  *) Fix plugin APIs to be compatible with the 64-bit changes in the
   core. This is an incompatible change with previous releases [TS-14].

  *) Fixes for stats around origin connection counters, used when allowing
   for origin connections to be reused between clients [TS-501].

  *) Experimental supoprt for a dedicated DNS thread. This can be enabled
   with the records.config option

   	   CONFIG proxy.config.dns.dedicated_thread INT 1

  This feature is possibly useful for very busy forward or transparent
  proxies [TS-307].

  *) Accept threads can leak some amount of memory. This patch also supports
   multiple accept threads (very experimental!) [TS-496].

  *) HttpSM has an assertion that checks the client URL against the cache
   URL, which breaks INKSetCacheUrl [TS-495].

  *) Return value from pcre_exec tested incorrectly [TS-493].

  *) Improved loop detection using the Via header [TS-490].

  *) Fixes for Solaris build (yay, it builds!).

  *) Remove filter.config remnants [TS-486].

  *) Cleanup in InkAPI [TS-485].

  *) Move PKGSYSUSER to ink_config.h.in [TS-482].

  *) Unresponsive server can stall ATS [TS-480].

  *) UrlRewrite cleanup [TS-434].

  *) Build TS with clang (author: Igor Galic) [TS-427].

  *) Better support and handling of DNS round-robin options (author: Zhao
   Yongming) [TS-313].

  *) Make it possible to "write" Content-Length headers > 2GB [TS-471].

  *) Better support for Age: headers, and avoiding overflows [TS-470].

  *) Added a configure option to size the API stats "slots". The new option
  is --with-max-api-stats=<n> [TS-454].

  *) In Cache.cc, make snprintf() around Debug statements conditional for
   performance [TS-459].

  *) Cleanup / optimize Via: string generation [TS-460]. Also make the
   default for Via: on responses to be disabled (it can leak info).


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.3

  *) Removed the remnants of NCA from the source [TS-455].

  *) New plugin APIs for stats, and making the "v2" (incomplete) stats
  experimental (no longer built by default) [TS-390]. See
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/NewStatsAPI for more
  details.

  *) Cleanup in duplicated configs, and obsoleted configs [TS-447] and
   [TS-451].

  *) Remove some remnants of SNMP [TS-401].

  *) Cleanup of MIX and LDAP/NTLM remnants [TS-443].

  *) Make the target fragment size configurable for the disk cache. This
   adds a new option, proxy.config.cache.target_fragment_size [TS-445].
   This should dramatically improve large file disk performance.

  *) Improve build include dependencies [TS-442].

  *) Cleanup / fixes for remap plugin chaining [TS-224].

  *) Support the rc/trafficserver script for FreeBSD [TS-211].

  *) traffic_shell shows wrong RAM cache size > 2GB [TS-439].

  *) Better warnings / errors when bad NIC is configured [TS-327].

  *) Add support for hardware sector sizes 512 - 8192 bytes (e.g. 4096, the
   new standard). Autodetected for raw devices on Linux (no support for
   other OSes yet), and added a new configuration

   	 CONFIG proxy.config.cache.force_sector_size INT 4096

   This change invalidates the entire cache as well, since it's no longer
   compatible [TS-43].

  *) Added APIs to override the cacheablity of the response [TS-395].

  *) Add OSX support to 'trafficserver' script (author: Dan Mercer)
   [TS-210].

  *) Fix for (very) large buffers fed to the cache [TS-413].

  *) Forward transparency is available on Linux kernels with TPROXY
   [TS-291].

  *) Fix defaults / max for DNS retries [TS-424].

  *) Improvements for Perl admin module (author: Adam Faris) [TS-418].

  *) Problems with specifying separate config files for SSL certificates and
   keys [TS-405].

  *) Logging: Default settings for diagnostic logging [TS-55].

  *) Fixes to Debian layout (author: Igor Galić) [TS-415].

  *) Remove DNS proxy support [TS-422].

  *) rc/trafficserver start/stop quits with bogus status on success (author:
   Igor Galić) [TS-429].

  *) Increase default max in-flight DNS queries [TS-423].

  *) Update so the pristine URL will work for reverse and forward proxy.
    Also, clearing the url on transaction close (author: Wendy Huang)
    [TS-410].

  *) TS fails to use user ID with user name > 8 characters (author: Yakov
   Markovitch) [TS-420].

  *) Duplication of RAM cache hits and miss statistics (reading 2x) (author:
   John Plevyak) [TS-453].


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.2

  *) Improvements in resilience against DNS poisoning and forging of
   response packets [TS-425] and [CVE-2010-2952].

  *) Segmentation fault in INKError when error output is made both in error
   log and as debug messages (author: Yakov Markovitch) [TS-419].

  *) Debian layout for config.layout (author: Igor Galic) [TS-415].

  *) Eliminate extraneous stats thread [TS-411].

  *) CACHE_FRAG_TYPE is now not a power of 2 [TS-76].

  *) Remove unnecessary stats update [TS-390].

  *) Get basic features to compile with Intel CC [TS-400].

  *) More 64 bit issues, this time in the PluginVC code [TS-380].

  *) Add configure option to enable detailed logging [TS-392].

  *) Make sure to honor user settings for "dirs" (author: Theo Schlossnagle)
   [TS-399].

  *) Errors on failing to bind / listen on a specified port [TS-247].

  *) Exempt quick filter for 127.0.0.1 [TS-397].

  *) Cleanup after "layout changes" (author: Zhao Yongming) [TS-389].

  *) Fix remaining (non-API) INK64 etc. [TS-365].

  *) Segfault when using show:network [TS-109].

  *) Update all examples to use non-deprecated APIs [TS-266].

  *) Do some cleanup on Connection::fast_connect and
   Connection::bind_connect (author: Alan M. Carrol) [TS-320].

  *) Remove LLONG config option [Ts-364].

  *) Cleanup some proxy/mgmt2/tools [TS-16].

  *) Cleanup a little more of webui [TS-91].

  *) TCL missing [TS-326].

  *) logstats does not work with layout changes (author: Zhao Yongming)
   [TS-385].

  *) Convert bogus IOCORE_MachineFatal and IOCORE_ProcessFatal to Warning
    and MachineFatal respectively based on review of the code and related
    uses [TS-144].

  *) INKIOBufferReaderCopy, INKIOBufferWrite should take void * instead of
   char * [TS-67].

  *) Adds APIs for aio disk read and writes using the internal aio support
    in iocore (author: Wendy Huang) [TS-387].

  *) Solaris 10 (x86) 64-bit patch (author: Igor Brezac) [TS-388].

  *) Fix for 64-bit conversion [TS-385].

  *) Creating transaction specific 'to URL' in case of regex remap match
   [TS-384].

  *) Backing out m_capacity_host changes [TS-383]

  *) Solaris 10 port work.


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.1

  *) Allow SI decimal multipliers for numeric configuration parameters
    [TS-361].

  *) Standardize configure options by allowing to specify the location for
    any third-party library, and split library detection code into separate
    .m4 files [TS-345].

  *) Reorganization of the path layout system.  Add --enable-layout=LAYOUT
    configure option that can select layout from config.layout file
    [TS-280].

  *) HTTP state machine is now 64-bit "clean", allowing for caching and
   proxying documents larger than 2GB [TS-34].
  
  *) Fix for truncated Content-Type on TS-generated responses [TS-290].

  *) Performance improvements on cache for larger(ish) objects.


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.0

  *) Support for many more platforms, including FreeBSD, MacOSX and Solaris.

  *) Code cleanup to get the ATS software into a distributable shape. This
   means that certain things are missing, or not functional (intentionally).

  *) Support for larger Cache Partitions up to .5 PB (Petabytes), reducing
   seeks/write.

  *) Reduced Cache miss latency (sub millesecond).

  *) RAM Cache pluggability, new algorithm (CLFUS) and optional compression.

  *) Support for TCL v8.6 and later [TS-246].

  *) The cache is now 64-bit "clean".


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.0.1

  *) Port of CVE-2010-2952 for 2.0.x [TS-425].

  *) Backport part of TS-322 that deals with indexing arrays with char
   (author: Marcus Ruckert) [TS-334].

  *) Backport TS-336 to 2.0.x. Problems with make install DESTDIR=...


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.0.0

  *) Change SDK versioning schemes to 2.0 [TS-249).

  *) Minor additions to the SDK (see the docs for details).

  *) Support regexe_map rules in remap.config [TS-80]


Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.0.0-alpha

  *) Code cleanup to get the ATS software into a distributable shape. This
   means that certain things are missing, or not functional (intentionally).

  *) Ports available for most Linux distros, including 64-bit.
