 * class VMap
 *   Class implements the protocol and support functions for mapping the
 * clusters virtual addresses. Member functions names are important here,
 * since this class shares a lock with the ClusterCom class:
 *
 *      lt_   "Lock Taken"   -- release the lock prior to invoking
 *      rl_   "Require Lock" -- acquire the lock prior to invoking
 *
 *   Care should also be taken when accessing any of the member variables,
 * a lock is generally required before modification should be made to them.
