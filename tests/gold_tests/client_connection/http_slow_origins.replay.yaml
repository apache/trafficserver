# Test Notes:
# This test makes the server reply slowly over multiple origin connections,
# allowing client-side connections to build up. This allows us to test our
# proxy.config.net.per_client.max_connections_in feature. This test assumes that
# proxy.config.net.per_client.max_connections_in is configured to 3 and assumes
# the fourth connection will be aborted by ATS.
#
# Be aware that Proxy Verifier will perform each of these sessions in parallel,
# not in serial. Thus, while there are multiple server side delays across the
# sessions, the delays are not additive. The client side delays are additive
# though. The replay should take about 3 seconds to complete after the fifth
# transaction completes.
