# Test run-plugin operator with a relative plugin path.
# This verifies that the plugin factory is properly initialized when
# header_rewrite is used as a remap plugin without a geo database.
# We use multiplexer.so because with no arguments it creates an empty
# instance and just returns TSREMAP_NO_REMAP, allowing the request to
# proceed normally to the backend.
