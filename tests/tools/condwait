# A bash script to wait for a condition to be true.
#
# usage:
#  condwait [ MAX-WAIT [ POST-WAIT ] ] CONDITION
#
# CONDITION is the ('test' command) condition to wait for.  (It may contain white space.)
#
# MAX-WAIT is the maximum number of seconds to wait for the condition.  If it is omitted, it defaults to 60.
#
# POST-WAIT is the number of seconds to wait after the condition is true.  If it is omitted, it defaults to 0.
#
# The script exits with status 0 when the condition is seen to be true.  It exits with status 1 if the condition
# is not seen to be true and the maximum wait has expired.
