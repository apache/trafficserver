# From the unit tests it seems PluginDso::load results in ASan reporting a leak
# from the function that actually calls dlopen, every handle that's created by
# this functions also calls dlclose, which was tested by checking if there was
# any outstanding handler open after we close them.
# This was also tested by counting how many times a dlopen was called compared
# against dlclose, both matched, so the last resource assume dlopen is doing
# something nasty or ASAN is detecting a false-positive.
