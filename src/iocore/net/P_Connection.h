  struct ConnectionManager
  ========================

  struct ConnectionManager provides the interface for network or disk
  connections.  There is a global ConnectionManager in the system
  (connectionManager).

  Connection * connect()
  Connection * accept()

  The accept call is a blocking call while connect is non-blocking. They
  returns a new Connection instance which is an handle to the newly created
  connection. The connection `q instance can be used later for read/writes
  using an instance of IOProcessor class.
