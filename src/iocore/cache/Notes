proxy/cluster/Cluster.h is now iocore/cluster/P_ClusterCache.h
Clustering compiles but only works if this module is compiled with the entire
TS because there are a lot of stuff required for clustering in proxy/http.


cache ifdefs
FIXME_HOSTDB -> Store ifdef to be turned off when HostDB stops using Store
FIXME_MGMT   -> Interface for warnings on the manager
FIXME_CLUSTER_ARGUMENTS -> runtime arguments for clustering etc. Needs
to be added by Eric

cluster ifdefs
FIXME_WIRELESS_API -> RPC API's for wireless which is probably not going to
be used in the future
