#flags and options are:
#
# enabled: default true, set true/false to enable/disable plugin for specific host
#
# remove-accept-encoding: this sets if the plugin should hide the accept encoding from origin servers
# - to ease the load on the origins
# - for when the proxy parses responses, and the resulting compression/decompression
#   is wastefull
#
# cache: when set, the plugin stores the uncompressed and compressed response as alternates
#
# compressible-content-type: wildcard pattern for matching compressible content types
#
# allow: wildcard pattern for allow/disallowing compression on urls
# - prefix pattern with ! to disallow
#
# compressible-status-code: a comma separated list of status codes in which to enable compression
#
# minimum-content-length: minimum content length for compression to be enabled (in bytes)
# - this setting only applies if the origin response has a Content-Length header
