ATS (Apache Traffic Server) Inliner plug-in
-----------------------------------------------

This is a global transformation plug-in that inlines base64 images on text/html responses.

Inliner:
   1. Detects the response to have header "Content-Type" set to "text/html".
   2. Without impacting streaming, scans the mark-up looking for "src" attributes
    into "img" tags.
   3. For each detected http/https url, checks for a "#inline" at its end.
   4. Checks on ATS cache if the url exists.
   5. In case the url exists into the cache. Inliner replaces the image with a 1x1
      base64 pixel and starts retrieving the content from the cache.
   6. Once the image is retrieved, buffers its content into memory.
   7. At the end of the orginal document, Inliner outputs a little JavaScript
      snippet.
   8. Inliner outputs every image found into the cache into a JavaScript function
      call.
   9. Once the JavaScript gets executed by the browser, the 1x1 pixels
      are replaced by their actual content.
  10. For the images which do not exist into the cache, Inliner preserve their
      original url and retrieves their content into background, also converting
      them to their base64 representation.

Please use "inliner" tag for debugging purposes.

Please add the inliner library into ATS plugins.conf configuration file.

No special configurations are required
