Apache Traffic Server Header Field Name Counter

This is a plugin for ATS (Apache Traffic Server) that counts the
number of times request header field names are used. For each request
the name of each field is added to a running total for that name. Over
time this provides a frequency map of header field names.


Using the plugin
----------------

This is a global plugin and does not take any configuration. Simply add it to plugin.config.

The frequency data is accessed via the plugin messaging facility. By
default the data is sent to traffic.out but it can be appended to an
arbitrary file. The first form logs to traffic.out, the second appends
to /tmp/log.tx. Note that this file must be writeable to the
traffic_server process user.

    traffic_ctl plugin msg header_freq log

    traffic_ctl plugin msg header_freq log:/tmp/log.txt
