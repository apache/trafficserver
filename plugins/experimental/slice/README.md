### Apache Traffic Server - Slicer Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to slice full file or range based requests
into deterministic chunks.  This allows a large file to be spread across
multiple cache stripes and allows range requests to be satisfied by
stitching these chunks together.

Deterministic chunks are requested from a parent cache or origin server
using a preconfigured block byte size.

The plugin is an example of an intercept handler which takes a single
incoming request (range or whole asset), breaks it into a sequence
of block requests and assembles those blocks into a client response.
The plugin uses TSHttpConnect to delegate each block request to
cache_range_requests.so which handles all cache and parent interaction.

To enable the plugin, specify the plugin library via @plugin at the end
of a remap line as follows (2MB slice in this example):

```
map http://ats-cache/ http://parent/ @plugin=slice.so @pparam=blockbytes:2097152 @plugin=cache_range_requests.so
```

for global plugins.

```
slice.so blockbytes:2097152
cache_range_requests.so
```

**Note**: cache_range_requests **MUST** follow slice.so Put these plugins at the end of the plugin list
**Note**: blockbytes is defined in bytes. 1048576 (1MB) is the default.

For testing purposes an unchecked value of "bytesover" is also available.

Debug output can be enable by setting the debug tag: **slice**

Debug messages related to object instance construction/deconstruction, see slice.h.  

At the current time only single range requests or the first part of a 
multi part range request of the forms:
```
Range: bytes=<begin>-<end>
Range: bytes=<begin>-
Range: bytes=-<last N bytes>
```
are supported as multi part range responses are non trivial to implement.
This matches with the cache_range_requests.so plugin capability.

---

Important things to note:

Any first block server response that is not a 206 is passed down to
the client.

Only the first server response block is used to evaluate any "If-"
headers.  Subsequent server slice block requests remove these headers.

If a client aborts mid transaction the current slice block is completed
to ensure that the block is written to cache.

The only 416 case this plugin handles itself is if the requested range
is inside the end slice block but past the content length.  Otherwise
parents seem to properly issue 416 responses themselves.

To manually build the plugin use the "tsxs" executable that installs with
traffic_server.

Running the following command will build the plugin

```
tsxs -v -o slice.so *.cc
```

Running the following command will build and install the plugin.
Beware this may crash a running system if the plugin is loaded
and the OS uses memory paging with plugins.

```
tsxs -v -i -o slice.so *.cc
```
