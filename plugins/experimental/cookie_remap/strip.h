/** Output the input after stripping all characters that are
 *  unsafe in an HTML context.
 *
 * This function performs the following treatment:
 *
 *   - strips from a '<' to the next unquoted '>'
 *
 *   - strips "&{" to the next unquoted '}' or "};"
 *
 *   - strips the character '>'
 *
 *   - strips the following characters: '\'', '"', unless the flag
 *     STRIP_FLAG_UNSAFE_QUOTES is present.
 *
 *   - strips the character '\\' unless the flag STRIP_FLAG_UNSAFE_SLASHES
 *     is present.
 *
 *   - leaves a single space character in place of each
 *     sequence of stripped characters if no other space
 *     preceeded the stripped sequence (e.g., "a <b>b" becomes
 *     "a b", but "a<b>b" becomes "a b")
 *
 * @param[in]     in        character array (string)
 * @param[in]     in_len    number of bytes in character array
 * @param[in,out] out       (in)storage for the resulting character array,
 *                          (out)contains the null terminated result
 * @param[in,out] out_len   (in)number of available bytes in out parameter,
 *                          (out)number of bytes used or required in out
 *                          (including NUL)
 * @param[in]     flags     zero or more function-specific flags:
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_LEAVE_WHITESP  - Leave whitespace in place.
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_STRIP_LOW      - Strip all values <= 0x07.
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_STRIP_HIGH     - Strip all values >= 0x80.
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_UNSAFE_QUOTES  - Leave apos and quote in place.
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_UNSAFE_SLASHES - Leave backslashes in place.
 *                - STRIP_FLAG_UNSAFE_SPACES  - Leave spaces in place.
 * @param[in]     charset   NULL or the charset used to treat the input
 *

 *    IV_RESULT_OK(0) on success.  Non-zero on failure.

 * EXAMPLES
 *
 *     Input                                 Output
 *     -----------------------------         -----------------------------
 *     <b>Bob & Mary</b>                     Bob & Mary
 *     "a phrase"                            a phrase
 *     Alice and Bob's house                 Alice and Bob s house
 * @endverbatim
 *
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 *     The function assumes ISO-8859-1 encoding.
 *
 *   - the caller is responsible for managing memory; the code
 *     does not allocate memory
 *
 *   - The function requires the input length to be specified
 *     and place the required and/or used length in the
 *     out_len parameter; this allows them to be efficiently
 *     used in environments that store something other than
 *     null terminated strings and also allows you to never
 *     call a function more than once (if the output buffer is
 *     too small on the first call, the value of out_len tells
 *     you how long the buffer needs to be)
 *
 *   - all length parameters specify the length of the
 *     corresponding string in bytes, not characters
 *
 *   - the input buffer does not need to be null-terminated
 *
 *   - the output is always null-terminated (except when it is
 *     not possible -- out==NULL || *out_len==0)
 *
 *   - no context is retained between calls
 *
 *     NOTES
 *
 *       - leading and trailing whitespace is stripped by default;
 *         pass STRIP_FLAG_LEAVE_WHITESP to leave leading and
 *         trailing whitespace in place
 *
 *       - when called with out_len less than the required
 *         length, IV_RESULT_OUTLEN_SMALL is returned with the
 *         required length in out_len and out set to the empty
 *         string
 *
 *       - can be called with out_len == 0 and out == NULL to
 *         compute sufficient storage size, which is returned
 *         in out_len
 *
 *       - when called with out_len == 0, the output is not
 *         NUL-terminated
