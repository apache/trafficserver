log_requests
==============

This plugin is used to help debug errored out transactions. 
We define errored out as any transaction returning a 4xx/5xx 
response code. By default, all transactions that return a 
4xx/5xx response code to the client will get its 
request/response headers logged into error.log.

We also provide a blacklist flag via the plugin arguments. Take 
for example this config in plugin.config:

    log_requests.so --no-log 414,502

Then log_requests would log every 4xx/5xx response code transaction
EXCEPT for 414 and 502.


Usage
------
When compiling ATS, run configure with the following flags:

    ./configure --enable-experimental-plugins


Then in plugin.config:
    
    log_requests.so [--log-proxy] [--no-log [error code 1[,error code 2[,...]]]]

    In other words, the --log-proxy and --no-log flags are optional. 
    --no-log should be followed with a comma separated list of error
    codes to blacklist.
