// Describe how proxy should deal with the handshake process of SSL
// connections passing though.
version = "0.1"

// Once the certificate load table surpasses this limit
// Start evicting already loaded certificates
runtime-table-size = "10000"

// By default the proxy will participate in the handshake, so it needs
// to have a certificate that it uses to handshake with the client, and
// potentially another certificate to handshake with the origin server
// In this case, the config must specify both the matching traffic conditions
// and the connection attributes (certificates, tickets, etc).

// Alternatively the proxy could be directed to get out of the way and
// blind tunnel the SSL connection.  There are no options to set in this
// case.  Only specify the matching traffic.

// There are two rule lists.  One that matches on characteristics of the
// origin server.
// Another that matches on characteristics of the client.

// The attributes specified by matches in both rule lists will be used
// to process the connection.  If either rule list specifies a "tunnel" action
// the connection will be blind tunneled. If either rule specifies a "deny"
// action, the handshake processing will stop

// Each rule list  will be evaluated in order and stop on a match
