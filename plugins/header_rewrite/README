Apache Traffic Server Rewrite Header Plugin
This is a plugin for ATS (Apache Traffic Server), that allows you to
perform various header "rewrite" rules (operations) on a request or
response. Currently, only one operation is supported, since we had to get
this rolling asap.

Using the plugin
----------------

This plugin can be used as both a global plugin, enabled in plugin.config:

  header_rewrite.so config_file_1.conf config_file_2.conf ...

These are global rules, which would apply to all requests. Another option is
to use per remap rules in remap.config

  map http://a http://b @plugin=header_rewrite.so @pparam=rules1.conf ...


In the second example, hooks which are not to be executed during the remap
phase (the default) causes a transaction hook to be instantiated and used
at a later time. This allows you to setup e.g. a rule that gets executed
during the origin response header parsing, using READ_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK.


Operators
---------
The following operators are available:

  rm-header header-name                 [flags]
  add-header header <value>             [flags]
  set-status <status-code>              [flags]
  set-status-reason <value>             [flags]
  set-config config <value>             [flags]
  no-op                                 [flags]
  counter counter-name                  [flags]

The following operator(s) currently only works when instantiating the
plugin as a remap plugin:

  set-destination [qual] value

Where qual is one of the support URL qualifiers

  HOST
  PORT
  PATH
  QUERY

For example (as a remap rule):

  cond %{HEADER:X-Mobile} = "foo"
  set-destination HOST foo.mobile.bar.com [L]


Operator flags
--------------
  [L]   Last rule, do not continue


Variable expansion
------------------
Currntly only limited variable expansion is supported in add-header. Supported
substitutions include:
  %<proto>      Protocol
  %<port>       Port
  %<chi>        Client IP
  %<cqhl>       Client request length
  %<cqhm>       Client HTTP method
  %<cquup>      Client unmapped URI


Conditions
----------
The conditions are used as qualifiers: The operators specified will
only be evaluated if the condition(s) are met.

  cond %{STATUS} operand                        [flags]
  cond %{RANDOM:nn} operand                     [flags]
  cond %{ACCESS:file}                           [flags]
  cond %{TRUE}                                  [flags]
  cond %{FALSE}                                 [flags]
  cond %{HEADER:header-name} operand            [flags]
  cond %{COOKIE:cookie-name} operand            [flags]
  cond %{CLIENT-HEADER:header-name} operand     [flags]
  cond %{PROTOCOL} operand                      [flags]
  cond %{PORT} operand                          [flags]
  cond %{HOST} operand                          [flags]
  cond %{TOHOST} operand                        [false]
  cond %{FROMHOST} operand                      [false]
  cond %{PATH} operand                          [false]
  cond %{PARAMS} operand                        [false]
  cond %{QUERY} operand                         [false]


The difference between HEADER and CLIENT-HEADER is that HEADER adapts to the
hook it's running in, whereas CLIENT-HEADER always applies to the client
request header. The %{TRUE} condition is also the default condition if no
other conditions are specified.

These conditions have to be first in a ruleset, and you can only have one in
each rule. This implies that a new hook condition starts a new rule as well.

  cond %{READ_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK}   (this is the default hook)
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  cond %{SEND_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  cond %{SEND_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK}

For remap.config plugin instanations, the default hook is named
REMAP_PSEUDO_HOOK. This can be useful if you are mixing other hooks in a
configuration, but being the default it is also optional.


Condition flags
---------------
  [NC]  Not case sensitive condition (when applicable)
  [AND] AND with next condition (default)
  [OR]  OR with next condition
  [NOT] Invert this condition


Operands to conditions
----------------------
  /string/  # regular expression
  <string   # lexically lower
  >string   # lexically greater
  =string   # lexically equal

The absense of a "matcher" means value exists).


Values
------
Setting e.g. a header with a value can take the following formats:

  - Any of the cond definitions, that extracts a value from the request
  - $N 0 <= N <= 9, as grouped in a regular expression
  - string (which can contain the above)
  - null


Examples
--------

cond %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar}
cond %{COOKIE:X-DC}  =DC1
add-header X-Y-Fiefum %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar}
add-header X-Forwarded-For %<chi>
rm-header X-Y-Foobar
rm-header Set-Cookie
counter plugin.header_rewrite.x-y-foobar-dc1

cond %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar} "Some string" [AND,NC]
