Apache Traffic Server Rewrite Header Plugin
This is a plugin for ATS (Apache Traffic Server), that allows you to
perform various header "rewrite" rules (operations) on a request or
response. Currently, only one operation is supported, since we had to get
this rolling asap.

Note that currently only static string "values" are supported. We'll add
advanced features to allow for expansions in a future release.


Operators
---------
The following operators are available: 

  rm-header header-name			[flags]
  add-header header <value>		[flags]
  set-status <status-code>		[flags]
  set-status-reason <value>		[flags]
  no-op		    			[flags]

The following operator(s) currently only works when instantiating the
plugin as a remap plugin:

  set-destination [qual] value

Where qual is one of the support URL qualifiers

  HOST
  PORT
  PATH
  QUERY

For example (as a remap rule):

  cond %{HEADER:X-Mobile} = "foo"
  set-destination HOST foo.mobile.bar.com [L]


Operator flags
--------------
  [L]	Last rule, do not continue


Conditions
----------
The conditions are used as qualifiers: The operators specified will
only be evaluated if the condition(s) are met.

  cond %{STATUS} operand			[flags]
  cond %{RANDOM:nn} operand			[flags]
  cond %{ACCESS:file}				[flags]
  cond %{TRUE}					[flags]
  cond %{FALSE}					[flags]
  cond %{HEADER:header-name} operand		[flags]
  cond %{CLIENT-HEADER:header-name} operand	[flags]
  cond %{METHOD} operand			[flags]
  cond %{PROTOCOL} operand			[flags]
  cond %{PORT} operand				[flags]
  cond %{HOST} operand				[flags]
  cond %{TOHOST} operand			[false]
  cond %{FROMHOST} operand			[false]
  cond %{PATH} operand				[false]
  cond %{PARAMS} operand			[false]
  cond %{QUERY} operand				[false]


The difference between HEADER and CLIENT-HEADER is that HEADER adapts to the
hook it's running in, whereas CLIENT-HEADER always applies to the client
request header. The %{TRUE} condition is also the default condition if no
other conditions are specified.

These conditions have to be first in a ruleset, and you can only have one in
each rule. This implies that a new hook condition starts a new rule as well.

  cond %{READ_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK}   (this is the default hook)
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  cond %{SEND_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  cond %{SEND_RESPONSE_HDR_HOOK}


Condition flags
---------------
  [NC]  Not ase sensitive condition (when applicable)
  [AND]	AND with next condition (default)
  [OR]	OR with next condition
  [NOT]	Invert this condition


Operands to conditions
----------------------
  /string/  # regular expression
  <string   # lexically lower
  >string   # lexically greater
  =string   # lexically equal

The absense of a "matcher" means value exists).


Values
------
Setting e.g. a header with a value can take the following formats:

  - Any of the cond definitions, that extracts a value from the request
  - $N 0 <= N <= 9, as grouped in a regular expression
  - string (which can contain the above)
  - null


Examples
--------

cond %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar}
cond %{METHOD} =GET [OR]
cond %{METHOD} =POST
set-header X-Y-Fiefum %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar}
rm-header X-Y-Foobar
rm-header Set-Cookie

cond %{HEADER:X-Y-Foobar} "Some string" [AND,NC]
