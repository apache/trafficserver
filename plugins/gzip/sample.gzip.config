#flags and options are:
#
# enable-gzip: default true, set true/false to enable/disable plugin for specific host
#
# remove-accept-encoding: this sets if the plugin should hide the accept encoding from origin servers
# - to ease the load on the origins
# - for when the proxy parses responses, and the resulting compression/decompression
#   is wastefull
#
# cache: when set, the plugin stores the uncompressed and compressed response as alternates
#
# compressible-content-type: wildcard pattern for matching compressible content types
#
# disallow: wildcard pattern for disablign compression on urls
