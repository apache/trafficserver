PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  *) HttpSM: TS can hang on HTTPS POST requests.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1228988
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1049
   +1: zwoop, niq
   niq comments:  This patch combines the bugfix with no-op stylistic
                  changes.  Not a big deal for a simple change, but in
                  general it risks complicating review.

  *) key->volume hash table is not consistent when a disk is marked as bad or removed due to failure
   Trunk patch: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=b2109cdaf55234621d6c3b2fcb4f15774f0939ab
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-949
   +1: zym
   -0: zwoop (I think this breaks compatibility with existing 3.0.x
   caches, and I'm not positive it's a good idea to do so).

  *) logstats incorrectly bucketizes all status codes greater than 599 as 5xx
   Trunk patch: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=8421675e42f9c09715ce02557afc258be7fed389
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1110
   +1: briang, igalic, zwoop

  *) Major performance problem with second request on same keep-alive connection
   Trunk patch: (See JIRA performance.try3.diff)
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-880
   +1: briang, zwoop
   
  *) Range requests that result in cache refresh give 200 status response with full contents
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1181280
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-824
   +1: briang, zwoop

STALLED ISSUES

  *) IOCORE: Fix for cross thread closing of VCs.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1201397
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-857
   +1: zym, ericb
   -1: amc, zwoop [I believe this is the base cause of the 3.1.1 instability]
   Note: we have find that something need to be fixed after TS-857, we'd like
     this patch to be merge later and leave some time for us to find out how to
     fix it. we are now testing the fix.
