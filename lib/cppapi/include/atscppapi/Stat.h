/**
 * @brief A Stat is an atomic variable that can be used to store counters, averages, time averages, or summations.
 *
 * All stats are exposed through the traffic_ctl program included with Apache Traffic Server. Additionally,
 * if you've enabled HttpStats all Stats you define will be displayed there. Stats can be read via
 * traffic_ctl metric get stat_name.
 *
 * Stats are very easy to use, here is a simple example of how you can create a counter and increment its
 * value:
 * \code
 *  Stat stat;
 *  stat.init("stat_name");
    stat.inc();
 * \endcode
 *
 * A full example is available in examples/stat_example/.
