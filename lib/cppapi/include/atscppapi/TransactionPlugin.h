/**
 * @brief The interface used when creating a TransactionPlugin.
 *
 * A Transaction Plugin is a plugin that will fire only for the specific Transaction it
 * was bound to. When you create a TransactionPlugin you call the parent constructor with
 * the associated Transaction and it will become automatically bound. This means that your
 * TransactionPlugin will automatically be destroyed when the Transaction dies.
 *
 * Implications of this are that you can easily add Transaction scoped storage by adding
 * a member to a TransactionPlugin since the destructor will be called of your TransactionPlugin
 * any cleanup that needs to happen can happen in your destructor as you normally would.
 *
 * You must always be sure to implement the appropriate callback for the type of hook you register.
 *
 * \code
 * // For a more detailed example see examples/transactionhook/
 * class TransactionHookPlugin : publicTransactionPlugin {
 * public:
 *   TransactionHookPlugin(Transaction &transaction) : TransactionPlugin(transaction) {
 *     char_ptr_ = new char[100]; // Transaction scoped storage
 *     registerHook(HOOK_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADERS);
 *   }
 *   virtual ~TransactionHookPlugin() {
 *     delete[] char_ptr_; // cleanup
 *   }
 *   void handleSendResponseHeaders(Transaction &transaction) {
 *     transaction.resume();
 *   }
 * private:
 *   char *char_ptr_;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
