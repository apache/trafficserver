.Dt CK_COHORT_INSTANCE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm CK_COHORT_INSTANCE
.Nd declare an instance of a cohort type
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_cohort.h
.Fn CK_COHORT_INSTANCE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The user must use this macro to declare instances of cohort types that they have
defined.  For instance, if they have used the CK_COHORT_PROTOTYPE macro to define
a cohort type with name foo, they would create an instance of this type as follows:
.br
CK_COHORT_INSTANCE(foo) cohort;
.Pp
This macro should also be used when allocating memory for cohorts.  For instance,
to allocate a block of 4 cohorts:
.br
CK_COHORT_INSTANCE(foo) *cohorts = malloc(4 * sizeof(CK_COHORT_INSTANCE(foo)));
