.Dt CK_EPOCH_POLL 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_epoch_poll
.Nd non-blocking poll of epoch object for dispatch cycles
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_epoch.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_epoch_poll "ck_epoch_t *epoch" "ck_epoch_record_t *record"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_epoch_poll 3
function will attempt to dispatch any functions associated with the
object pointed to by
.Fa epoch
via
.Fn ck_epoch_call 3
if deemed safe. This function is meant to be used in cases epoch
reclamation cost must be amortized over time in a manner that does
not affect caller progress.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function will return true if at least one function was dispatched.
This function will return false if it has determined not all threads have
observed the latest generation of epoch-protected objects. Neither value
indicates an error.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if the object pointed to by
.Fa epoch
is not a valid epoch object. The object pointed to by
.Fa record
must have been previously registered via
.Fn ck_epoch_register 3 .
