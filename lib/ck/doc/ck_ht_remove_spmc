.Dt CK_HT_GROW_SPMC 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_ht_remove_spmc
.Nd resize a hash table if necessary
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_ht.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_ht_remove_spmc "ck_ht_t *ht" "ck_ht_hash_t h" "ck_ht_entry_t *entry"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_ht_remove_spmc
function will remove the key-value pair associated with the
key specified by the
.Fa entry
argument.
.Pp
If
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_BYTESTRING then
.Fa entry
must have been initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_entry_set_key 3
or
.Xr ck_ht_entry_set 3
functions. If
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_DIRECT then
.Fa entry
must have been initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_entry_key_set_direct 3
or
.Xr ck_ht_entry_set_direct 3
functions.
.Pp
It is expected that
.Fa h
was initialized with
.Xr ck_ht_hash 3
if
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_BYTESTRING. If
.Fa ht
was initialized with CK_HT_MODE_DIRECT then it is
expected that
.Fa h
was initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_hash_direct 3
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fa entry
will contain the key-value pair that was found in the hash table
and
.Fn ck_ht_remove_spmc
will return
.Dv true.
If the entry could not be found then
.Fn ck_ht_remove_spmc
will return
.Dv false.
