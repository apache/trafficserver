.Dt CK_BITMAP_INIT 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_bitmap_init
.Nd initialize a bitmap
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_bitmap.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_bitmap_init "ck_bitmap_t *bitmap" "unsigned int n_bits" "bool set"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_bitmap_init
function initializes the bitmap pointed to by the
.Fa bitmap
pointer. The argument
.Fa n_bits
specifies the number of bits that are to be stored in the bitmap.
The argument
.Fa set
determines whether the values of the bits in
.Fa bitmap
are to be initialized to
.Dv 1
or
.Dv 0 .
.Pp
It is expected that
.Fa bitmap
points to a contiguous region of memory containing at least
the number of bytes specified by
.Xr ck_bitmap_size 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function has no return value.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.Pp
The behavior of
.Fn ck_bitmap_init
is undefined if
.Fa bitmap
is not a pointer to a region of bytes
of at least
.Xr ck_bitmap_size 3
length.
