.Dt CK_BITMAP_BUFFER 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_bitmap_buffer
.Nd returns pointer to bit array
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_bitmap.h
.Ft void *
.Fn ck_bitmap_buffer "ck_bitmap_t *bitmap"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_bitmap_buffer
functions returns a pointer to the actual bit array.
For ck_bitmap pointers, the bit array is of type
CK_BITMAP_WORD[] and consists of
ck_bitmap_base(bitmap) / sizeof(CK_BITMAP_WORD) elements.
On currently supported 64-bit platforms
.Dv CK_BITMAP_WORD
is
.Dv uint64_t .
On currently supported 32-bit platforms
.Dv CK_BITMAP_WORD
is
.Dv uint32_t .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function returns a non-NULL value.
