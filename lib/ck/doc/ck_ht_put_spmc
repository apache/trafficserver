.Dt CK_HT_PUT_SPMC 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_ht_put_spmc
.Nd store unique key-value pair into hash table
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_ht.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_ht_put_spmc "ck_ht_t *ht" "ck_ht_hash_t h" "ck_ht_entry_t *entry"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_ht_put_spmc
function will store the key-value pair specified in the
.Fa entry
argument in the hash table pointed to by the
.Fa ht
argument. The key specified in
.Fa entry
is expected to have the hash value specified by the
.Fa h
argument.
.Pp
If
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_BYTESTRING then
.Fa entry
must have been initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_entry_set 3
function. If
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_DIRECT then
.Fa entry
must have been initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_entry_set_direct 3
function.
.Pp
It is expected that
.Fa h
was initialized with
.Xr ck_ht_hash 3
if
.Fa ht
was created with CK_HT_MODE_BYTESTRING. If
.Fa ht
was initialized with CK_HT_MODE_DIRECT then it is
expected that
.Fa h
was initialized with the
.Xr ck_ht_hash_direct 3
function.
.Pp
If the call to
.Fn ck_ht_put_spmc
was successful then the key-value pair in
.Fa entry
was successfully stored in the hash table pointed
to by
.Fa ht
and will fail if the key specified in
.Fa entry
already exists with-in the hash table. Replacement semantics
are provided by the
.Xr ck_ht_set_spmc 3
function.
.Pp
This function is safe to call in the presence of concurrent
.Xr ck_ht_get_spmc 3
operations.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn ck_ht_put_spmc
returns
.Dv true
and otherwise returns
.Dv false
on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa entry
or
.Fa ht
are uninitialized. The function will return
.Dv false
if the hash table required to be grown but failed
while attempting to grow or if the key specified
in
.Fa entry
was already present in the hash table.
