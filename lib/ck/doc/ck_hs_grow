.Dt CK_HS_GROW 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_hs_grow
.Nd enlarge hash set capacity
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_hs.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_hs_grow "ck_hs_t *hs" "unsigned long capacity"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_hs_grow 3
function will resize the hash set in order to be
able to store at least the number of entries specified by
.Fa capacity
at a load factor of one. The default hash set load factor
is 0.5. If you wish to minimize the likelihood of memory allocations
for a hash set meant to store n entries, then specify a
.Fa capacity
of 2n. The default behavior of ck_hs is to round
.Fa capacity
to the next power of two if it is not already a power of two.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn ck_hs_grow 3
returns true and otherwise returns false on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa hs
is uninitialized. This function will only
return false if there are internal memory allocation
failures.
