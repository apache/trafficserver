.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_epoch_register
.Nd register a thread for epoch reclamation
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_epoch.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_epoch_register "ck_epoch_t *epoch" "ck_epoch_record_t *record"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_epoch_register 3
function associates a record object specified by the
.Fa record
pointer with the epoch object pointed to by
.Fa epoch .
Any thread or processor that will require safe memory reclamation
guarantees must register a unique record object. After registration, the
object pointed to by the
.Fa record
argument will have lifetime managed by the underlying epoch sub-system.
The record object must not be destroyed after it is associated with a
.Fn ck_epoch_register 3
call.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function has no return value.
