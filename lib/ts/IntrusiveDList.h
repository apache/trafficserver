/** @file

    Intrusive double linked list container.

    This provide support for a doubly linked list container for an
    arbitrary class that uses the class directly and not wrapped. It
    requires the class to provide the list pointers.

    @note This is a header only library.

    @note Due to bugs in either the C++ standard or gcc (or both), the
    link members @b must be declared in the class used for the
    list. If they are declared in a super class you will get "could
    not convert template argument" errors, even though it should
    work. This is because @c &T::m is of type @c S::* if @c S is a
    super class of @c T and @c m is declared in @c S. My view is that
    if I write "&T::m" I want a "T::*" and the compiler shouldn't go
    rummaging through the class hierarchy for some other type. For
    MSVC you can @c static_cast the template arguments as a
    workaround, but not in gcc.

/** Intrusive doubly linked list container.

    This holds items in a doubly linked list using members of the
    items.  Elements are copied in to the list. No memory management
    is done by the list implementation.

    To use this class a client should create the structure for
    elements of the list and ensure that it has two self pointers to
    be used by the list. For example,

    @code
      struct Elt {
        int _payload;
        Elt* _next;
        Elt* _prev;
      };
    @endcode

    The list is declared as
    @code
      typedef IntrusiveDList<Elt, &Elt::_next, &Elt::_prev> EltList;
    @endcode

    An element can be in multiple types of lists simultaneously as
    long as each list type uses distinct members. It is not possible
    for an element to be in more than one list of the same type
    simultaneously.  This is intrinsic to intrusive list support.

    Element access is done by using either STL style iteration, or
    direct access to the member pointers. A client can have its own
    mechanism for getting an element to start, or use the @c getHead
    and/or @c getTail methods to get the first and last elements in
    the list respectively.

    @note Due to bugs in various compilers or the C++ specification
    (or both) it is not possible in general to declare the element
    pointers in a super class. The template argument @c T must be
    exactly the same @c T as for the element pointers, even though a
    pointer to member of a superclass should be trivially coerced to a
    pointer to member of subclass. MSVC permits an explicit cast in
    this case, but gcc does not and therefore there is no way to do
    this. It is most vexing.

    P.S. I think it's a compiler bug personally with regard to the
    type of an expression of the form @c &T::M is not @c T::* if @c M
    is declared in a superclass S. In that case the type is @c S::*
    which seems very wrong to me.
