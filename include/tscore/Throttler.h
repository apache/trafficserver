/** A class that exposes an interface for generic throttling of some action
 * against a certain interval.
 *
 * To use:
 *
 * 1. Create an instance of this class specifying the interval for which
 * something should be throttled. Alternatively, inherit from this class to
 * have the throttling interface apply to the object you want throttling for.
 *
 * 2. Prepend each decision for a given throttled action with a call to
 * is_throttled.
 *
 *   2a. If the is_throttled is false, then at least the configured number of
 *   microseconds has elapsed since the previous call in which is_throttled
 *   returned false. The number of times the check has been called between
 *   these two times is provided in the suppressed_count output parameter.
 *
 *   2b. If is_throttled returns returns true, then not enough time has elapsed
 *   since the last time the operation returned true per the throttling
 *   interval. Thus the operation should be skipped or suppressed, depending
 *   upon the context.
 *
 * For instance:
 *
 *    void foo()
 *    {
 *      using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 *      static Throttler t(300ms);
 *      uint64_t suppressed_count;
 *      if (!t.is_throttled(suppressed_count)) {
 *        std::printf("Alan bought another monitor\n");
 *        std::printf("We ignored Alan buying a monitor %llu times\n", suppressed_count);
 *      }
 *    }

   *
   * @param[out] suppressed_count If the return of this call is false (the action
   * should not be suppressed), this is populated with the approximate number
   * of suppressed events between the last unsuppressed event and the current
   * one.  Otherwise the value is not set. This value is approximate because,
   * if used in a multithreaded context, other threads may be querrying against
   * this function as well concurrently, and their count may not be applied
   * depending upon the timing of their query.
   *
   * @return True if the action is suppressed per the configured interval,
   * false otherwise.
