/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Encoding::escapify_url_common

  This routine will escapify a URL to remove spaces (and perhaps other ugly
  characters) from a URL and replace them with a hex escape sequence.
  Since the escapes are larger (multi-byte) than the characters being
  replaced, the string returned will be longer than the string passed.

  This is a worker function called by escapify_url and pure_escapify_url.  These
  functions differ on whether the function tries to detect and avoid
  double URL encoding (escapify_url) or not (pure_escapify_url)
