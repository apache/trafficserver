/** Small fast histogram.
 *
 * This is a stepped logarithmic histogram. Each range is twice the size of the previous range. Each range is divided into equal
 * sized spans, with a bucket for each span. The ranges and spans are defined by the @a R and @a S template parameters. There is
 * an underflow range for values less than @c 2^S. There is a range for each power of 2 from @c 2^S to @c 2^(S+R-1) and overflow
 * bucket for values greater than or equal to @c 2^(R+S-1).
 *
 * This can also been seen as having a range for each bit from @c S to @c S+R-1. The bucket is determined by the most significant
 * bit of the value. If it is past @c S+R-1 then it is put in the overflow bucket. If the MSB is less than @c S then it is put in
 * a bucket in the underflow range, values <tt>0 .. (2^S)-1</tt>. For normal ranges, the range is determined by the bit index and
 * the next @c S bits are used as an index into the buckets for that range. Note this is the same for the underflow range which is
 * used when the MSB is in the first @c S bits.
 *
 * For example, if @a S is 2 then the buckets are (where @c U is an underflow bucket)
 * <tt>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14,16,20,24,28, ...</tt> <- Sample value
 * <tt>U U U U 0 0 0 0 1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  ...</tt> <- Range
 *
 * To keep data relevant there is a decay mechanism will divides all of the bucket counts by 2. If done periodically this creates
 * an exponential decay of sample data, which is less susceptible to timing issues. Instances can be summed so that parallel
 * instances can be kept on different threads without locking and then combined.
 *
 * @tparam R Bits for the overall range of the histogram.
 * @tparam S Bits used for spans inside a range.
