#
# Rules:
# Each rule is a mapping, with the tags
#
#   apply: Either "in" or "out" to apply to inbound and outbound connections respectively.
#   ip_addrs: IP address ranges, either a single range or a list of ranges.
#   action: "allow" or "deny"
#   methods: A method name or sequence of method names. Available methods: GET, CONNECT, DELETE,
#            HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PURGE, PUT, TRACE, PUSH. The special name "ALL" indicates all
#            methods and it overrides any other methods.
#
# A rule must have either "src" or "dst" to indicate if the IP addresses apply to inbound connections
# or outbound connections.
#
# The top level tag 'ip_allow' identifies the rule items. Its value must be a rule item or a
# sequence of rule items.
#
# Rules are applied in the order listed starting from the top.
# That means you generally want to append your rules after the ones listed here.
#
# Allow anything on localhost, limit destructive methods elsewhere.
