<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p>This plugin is based on the null-transform sample plugin. It inserts several 
  APIs in the TSIOBuffer*, TSVConn*, TSVIO* and other categories into the appropriate 
  places for testing.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Feature Description</b></font></p>
<p>In the TSPluginInit(), the plugin calls a test_iobuffer() function, which 
  tests the IOBuffer functions in the following way:</p>
<p>It creates an an IOBuffer and a full IOBufferBlock. Then it appends the block 
  to the IOBuffer. Since the block in the IOBuffer is full, when TSIOBufferStart 
  is called, it will add a new block to the IOBuffer and the its return value 
  points to the new block. The plugin checks if this is true and prints out the 
  pass/fail information to the log file. Then it gets the read avail of the first 
  block and write avail of the second block of the IOBuffer and prints out the 
  values to the log file.</p>
<p>The plugin instructs the HTTP state machine to cache the transform version 
  of the server response. It tries to get the transform response header and if 
  it succeeds, it adds a Content-Encoding: null header field to the transform 
  header.</p>
<p>During the transformation process, the plugin gets the write VIO for the vconnection, 
  and gets the mutex of the write VIO. This mutex should equal to the mutex of 
  the continuation. If not, it prints out an error message to the log. It also 
  gets the VConnection of the write VIO. It should equal to the continuation. 
  If not, it prints out an error message to the log.</p>
