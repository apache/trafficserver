# These can (should?) be overriden from the command line with ----build-arg, e.g.
#    docker build --build-arg OS_VERSION=7 --build-arg OS_TYPE=centos
#
ARG OS_VERSION=28
ARG OS_TYPE=fedora

# This does currently not work, e.g. this I'd expect to make it conditional:
#
#    RUN if [ "${ADD_JENKINS}" = "yes" ]; then yum ...
#
ARG ADD_JENKINS=no

# Alright, lets pull in the base image from docker.io
