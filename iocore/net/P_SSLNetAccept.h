  P_SSLNetAccept.h


   NetAccept is a generalized facility which allows
   Connections of different classes to be accepted either
   from a blockable thread or by adaptive polling.

   It is used by the NetProcessor and the ClusterProcessor
   and should be considered PRIVATE to processor implementations.
