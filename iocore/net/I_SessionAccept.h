/**
   The base class SessionAccept can not be used directly. The inherited class of
   SessionAccept (ex. HttpSessionAccept) is designed to:

     - Check IPAllow policy.
     - Create ClientSession.
     - Pass NetVC and MIOBuffer by call ClientSession::new_connection().

   nullptr mutex:

     - One specific protocol has ONLY one inherited class of SessionAccept.
     - The object of this class is shared by all incoming request / NetVC that
       identified as the protocol by ProtocolSessionProbe.
     - The inherited class of SessionAccept is non-blocking to allow parallel accepts/

   To implement a inherited class of SessionAccept:

     - No state is recorded by the handler.
     - Values are required to be set during construction and never changed.
     - Can not put into EventSystem.

   So a nullptr mutex is safe for the continuation.
