     to the NIC.
     @param recv_bufsize (optional) Socket buffer size for sending.
     Limits how much can be queued by OS before we read it.

  // Regarding sendto_re, sendmsg_re, recvfrom_re:
  // * You may be called back on 'c' with completion or error status.

  //   with the completion event.
  // * If IOBufferBlock * is passed in the interface, it is reference
  //   counted internally.
  // * For recvfrom_re, data is written beginning at IOBufferBlock::end() and
  //   the IOBufferBlock is not fill()'ed until I/O actually occurs.  This
  //   kind of implies that you can only have one outstanding I/O per
  //   IOBufferBlock

  // * callback signature is: handleEvent(int event,CompletionEvent *cevent);
  //   where event is one of:
  //  NET_EVENT_DATAGRAM_WRITE_COMPLETE
  //  NET_EVENT_DATAGRAM_WRITE_ERROR
  // * You can get the value of 'token' that you passed in by calling
  //   completionUtil::getHandle(cevent);
  // * You can get other info about the completed operation through use
  //   of the completionUtil class.
