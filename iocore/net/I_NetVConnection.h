    Sets time after which SM should be notified.

    Sets the amount of time (in nanoseconds) after which the state

    if neither the read side nor the write side of the connection
    is currently active. The timer is reset if the function is
    called repeatedly This call can be used by SMs to make sure
    that it does not keep any connections open for a really long
    time.

    Timeout semantics:

    Should a timeout occur, the state machine for the read side of
    the NetVConnection is signaled first assuming that a read has
    been initiated on the NetVConnection and that the read side of
    the NetVConnection has not been shutdown. Should either of the
    two conditions not be met, the NetProcessor will attempt to
    signal the write side. If a timeout is sent to the read side
    state machine and its handler, return EVENT_DONE, a timeout
    will not be sent to the write side. Should the return from the
    handler not be EVENT_DONE and the write side state machine is
    different (in terms of pointer comparison) from the read side
    state machine, the NetProcessor will try to signal the write
    side state machine as well. To signal write side, a write must
    have been initiated on it and the write must not have been
    shutdown.

    Receiving a timeout is only a notification that the timer has
    expired. The NetVConnection is still usable. Further timeouts
    of the type signaled will not be generated unless the timeout
    is reset via the set_active_timeout() or set_inactivity_timeout()
