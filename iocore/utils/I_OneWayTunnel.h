  @section details Details

  Part of the utils library which contains classes that use multiple
  components of the IO-Core to implement some useful functionality. The
  classes also serve as good examples of how to use the IO-Core.

/**
  A generic state machine that connects two virtual conections. A
  OneWayTunnel is a module that connects two virtual connections, a source
  vc and a target vc, and copies the data between source and target. Once
  the tunnel is started using the init() call, it handles all the events
  from the source and target and optionally calls a continuation back when
  its done. On success it calls back the continuation with VC_EVENT_EOS,
  and with VC_EVENT_ERROR on failure.

  If manipulate_fn is not nullptr, then the tunnel acts as a filter,
  processing all data arriving from the source vc by the manipulate_fn
  function, before sending to the target vc. By default, the manipulate_fn
  is set to nullptr, yielding the identity function. manipulate_fn takes
  a IOBuffer containing the data to be written into the target virtual
  connection which it may manipulate in any manner it sees fit.
