  @section details Details

  Part of the utils library which contains classes that use multiple
  components of the IO-Core to implement some useful functionality. The
  classes also serve as good examples of how to use the IO-Core.

  The Machine is a simple place holder for the hostname and the ip
  address of an internet host.

  If a hostname or an IP address is not provided in the constructor,
  the hostname defaults to the name of the current processor and the
  IP address is the address of the current host.  If the host has
  multiple IP addresses, the numerically lowest IP address is used.
  The IP address is stored in the network byte order.

  @internal This does not handle multi-homed systems. That should be
  fixed.
