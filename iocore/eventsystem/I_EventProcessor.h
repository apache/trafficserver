/**
  Main processor for the Event System. The EventProcessor is the core
  component of the Event System. Once started, it is responsible for
  creating and managing groups of threads that execute user-defined
  tasks asynchronously at a given time or periodically.

  The EventProcessor provides a set of scheduling functions through
  which you can specify continuations to be called back by one of its
  threads. These function calls do not block. Instead they return an
  Event object and schedule the callback to the continuation passed in at
  a later or specific time, as soon as possible or at certain intervals.

  Singleton model:

  Every executable that imports and statically links against the
  EventSystem library is provided with a global instance of the
  EventProcessor called eventProcessor. Therefore, it is not necessary to
  create instances of the EventProcessor class because it was designed
  as a singleton. It is important to note that none of its functions
  are reentrant.

  Thread Groups (Event types):

  When the EventProcessor is started, the first group of threads is spawned and it is assigned the
  special id ET_CALL. Depending on the complexity of the state machine or protocol, you may be
  interested in creating additional threads and the EventProcessor gives you the ability to create a
  single thread or an entire group of threads. In the former case, you call spawn_thread and the
  thread is independent of the thread groups and it exists as long as your continuation handle
  executes and there are events to process. In the latter, you call @c registerEventType to get an
  event type and then @c spawn_event_theads which creates the threads in the group of that
  type. Such threads require events to be scheduled on a specicif thread in the group or for the
  grouop in general using the event type. Note that between these two calls @c
  EThread::schedule_spawn can be used to set up per thread initialization.

  Callback event codes:

  @b UNIX: For all of the scheduling functions, the callback_event
  parameter is not used. On a callback, the event code passed in to
  the continuation handler is always EVENT_IMMEDIATE.

  @b NT: The value of the event code passed in to the continuation
  handler is the value provided in the callback_event parameter.

  Event allocation policy:

  Events are allocated and deallocated by the EventProcessor. A state
  machine may access the returned, non-recurring event until it is
  cancelled or the callback from the event is complete. For recurring
  events, the Event may be accessed until it is cancelled. Once the event
  is complete or cancelled, it's the eventProcessor's responsibility to
  deallocate it.
