  @section details Details

  Continuations have a handleEvent() method to invoke them. Users
  can determine the behavior of a Continuation by suppling a
  "ContinuationHandler" (member function name) which is invoked
  when events arrive. This function can be changed with the
  "setHandler" method.

  Continuations can be subclassed to add additional state and
  methods.

/**
  Base class for all state machines to receive notification of
  events.

  The Continuation class represents the main abstraction mechanism
  used throughout the IO Core Event System to communicate its users
  the occurrence of an event. A Continuation is a lightweight data
  structure that implements a single method with which the user is
  called back.

  Continuations are typically subclassed in order to implement
  event-driven state machines. By including additional state and
  methods, continuations can combine state with control flow, and
  they are generally used to support split-phase, event-driven
  control flow.

  Given the multithreaded nature of the Event System, every
  continuation carries a reference to a ProxyMutex object to protect
  its state and ensure atomic operations. This ProxyMutex object
  must be allocated by continuation-derived classes or by clients
  of the IO Core Event System and it is required as a parameter to
  the Continuation's class constructor.
