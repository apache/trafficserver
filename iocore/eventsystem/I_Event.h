/**
  A type of Action returned by the EventProcessor. The Event class
  is the type of Action returned by the EventProcessor as a result
  of scheduling an operation. Unlike asynchronous operations
  represented by actions, events never call reentrantly.

  Besides being able to cancel an event (because it is an action),
  you can also reschedule it once received.

  <b>Remarks</b>

  When rescheduling an event through any of the Event class
  scheduling functions, state machines must not make these calls
  in other thread other than the one that called them back. They
  also must have acquired the continuation's lock before calling
  any of the scheduling functions.

  The rules for canceling an event are the same as those for
  actions:

  The canceler of an event must be the state machine that will be
  called back by the task and that state machine's lock must be
  held while calling cancel. Any reference to that event object
  (ie. pointer) held by the state machine must not be used after
  the cancellation.

  Event Codes:

  At the completion of an event, state machines use the event code
  passed in through the Continuation's handler function to distinguish
  the type of event and handle the data parameter accordingly. State
  machine implementers should be careful when defining the event
  codes since they can impact on other state machines presents. For
  this reason, this numbers are usually allocated from a common
  pool.

  Time values:

  The scheduling functions use a time parameter typed as ink_hrtime
  for specifying the timeouts or periods. This is a nanosecond value
  supported by libts and you should use the time functions and
  macros defined in ink_hrtime.h.

  The difference between the timeout specified for schedule_at and
  schedule_in is that in the former it is an absolute value of time
  that is expected to be in the future where in the latter it is
  an amount of time to add to the current time (obtained with
  ink_get_hrtime).
