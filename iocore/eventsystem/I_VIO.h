/**
  Descriptor for an IO operation.

  A VIO is a descriptor for an in progress IO operation. It is
  returned from do_io_read() and do_io_write() methods on VConnections.
  Through the VIO, the state machine can monitor the progress of
  an operation and reenable the operation when data becomes available.

  The VIO operation represents several types of operations, and
  they can be identified through the 'op' member. It can take any
  of the following values:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><b>Constant</b></td>
      <td align="center"><b>Meaning</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>READ</td><td>The VIO represents a read operation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>WRITE</td><td>The VIO represents a write operation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CLOSE</td><td>The VIO represents the request to close the
                          VConnection</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ABORT</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>SHUTDOWN_READ</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>SHUTDOWN_WRITE</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>SHUTDOWN_READWRITE</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>SEEK</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>PREAD</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>PWRITE</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>STAT</td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
