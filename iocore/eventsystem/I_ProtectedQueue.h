/****************************************************************************

  Protected Queue, a FIFO queue with the following functionality:
  (1). Multiple threads could be simultaneously trying to enqueue
       and dequeue. Hence the queue needs to be protected with mutex.
  (2). In case the queue is empty, dequeue() sleeps for a specified
       amount of time, or until a new element is inserted, whichever
       is earlier
