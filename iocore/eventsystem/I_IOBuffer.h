  @section watermark Watermark

  Watermarks can be used as an interface between the data transferring
  layer (VConnection) and the user layer (a state machine).  Watermarks
  should be used when you need to have at least a certain amount of data
  to make some determination.  For example, when parsing a string, one
  might wish to ensure that an entire line will come in before consuming
  the data.  In such a case, the water_mark should be set to the largest
  possible size of the string. (appropriate error handling should take
  care of excessively long strings).

  In all other cases, especially when all data will be consumed, the
  water_mark should be set to 0 (the default).
