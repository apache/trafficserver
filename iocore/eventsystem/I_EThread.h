/**
  Event System specific type of thread.

  The EThread class is the type of thread created and managed by
  the Event System. It is one of the available interfaces for
  scheduling events in the event system (another two are the Event
  and EventProcessor classes).

  In order to handle events, each EThread object has two event
  queues, one external and one internal. The external queue is
  provided for users of the EThread (clients) to append events to
  that particular thread. Since it can be accessed by other threads
  at the same time, operations using it must proceed in an atomic
  fashion.

  The internal queue, in the other hand, is used exclusively by the
  EThread to process timed events within a certain time frame. These
  events are queued internally and they may come from the external
  queue as well.

  Scheduling Interface:

  There are eight scheduling functions provided by EThread and
  they are a wrapper around their counterparts in EventProcessor.
