  @section details Details

  ProtectedQueue implements a FIFO queue with the following functionality:
    -# Multiple threads could be simultaneously trying to enqueue and
      dequeue. Hence the queue needs to be protected with mutex.
    -# In case the queue is empty, dequeue() sleeps for a specified amount
      of time, or until a new element is inserted, whichever is earlier.

*/

#include "P_EventSystem.h"

// The protected queue is designed to delay signaling of threads
// until some amount of work has been completed on the current thread
// in order to prevent excess context switches.
//
// Defining EAGER_SIGNALLING disables this behavior and causes
// threads to be made runnable immediately.
//
// #define EAGER_SIGNALLING
