  @section details Details

  Thread class provides the basic functionality for threads. Typically,
  there will be additional derived classes. Having a common base class
  for all threads is useful in many cases. I discuss below the use of
  Threads in the context of Event Subsystem. Hopefully this would be
  typical of other situations.

  EventProcessor needs to create a bunch of threads. It declares a
  class called EThread, derived from Thread. It is the responsibility of
  the EventProcessor to create and manage all the threads needed in the
  Event Subsystem (Note: we have removed the original ThreadManager class
  which used to create and manage *all* the threads in the system). By
  monitoring, we mean checking the heartbeat of each thread and the
  number of threads in the system etc.

  A derived class should either provide the function (and arguments)
  needed by the Thread class (see start()), or should define the virtual
  function execute().

  The Thread class maintains a thread_key which registers *all*
  the threads in the system (that have been created using Thread or
  a derived class), using thread specific data calls.  Whenever, you
  call this_thread() you get a pointer to the Thread that is currently
  executing you.  Additionally, the EThread class (derived from Thread)
  maintains its own independent key. All (and only) the threads created
  in the Event Subsystem are registered with this key. Thus, whenever you
  call this_ethread() you get a pointer to EThread. If you happen to call
  this_ethread() from inside a thread which is not an EThread, you will
  get a nullptr value (since that thread will not be  registered with the
  EThread key). This will hopefully make the use of this_ethread() safer.
  Note that an event created with EThread can also call this_thread(),
  in which case, it will get a pointer to Thread (rather than to EThread).
