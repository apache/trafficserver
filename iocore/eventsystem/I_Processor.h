/**
   Base class for all of the IO Core processors.

   The Processor class defines a common interface for all the
   processors in the IO Core. A processor is multithreaded subsystem
   specialized in some type of task or application. For example,
   the Event System module includes the EventProcessor which provides
   schedulling services, the Net module includes the NetProcessor
   which provides networking services, etc.

   You cannot create objects of the Processor class and its methods
   have no implementation. Therefore, you are expected to use objects
   of a derived type.

   Most of such derived classes, provide a singleton object and is
   common case to have a single instance in that application scope.
