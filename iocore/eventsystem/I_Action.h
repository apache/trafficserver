/**
  Represents an operation initiated on a Processor.

  The Action class is an abstract representation of an operation
  being executed by some Processor. A reference to an Action object
  allows you to cancel an ongoing asynchronous operation before it
  completes. This means that the Continuation specified for the
  operation will not be called back.

  Actions or classes derived from Action are the typical return
  type of methods exposed by Processors in the Event System and
  throughout the IO Core libraries.

  The canceller of an action must be the state machine that will
  be called back by the task and that state machine's lock must be
  held while calling cancel.

  Processor implementers:

  You must ensure that no events are sent to the state machine after
  the operation has been cancelled appropriately.

  Returning an Action:

  Processor functions that are asynchronous must return actions to
  allow the calling state machine to cancel the task before completion.
  Because some processor functions are reentrant, they can call
  back the state machine before the returning from the call that
  creates the actions. To handle this case, special values are
  returned in place of an action to indicate to the state machine
  that the action is already completed.

    - @b ACTION_RESULT_DONE The processor has completed the task
      and called the state machine back inline.
    - @b ACTION_RESULT_INLINE Not currently used.
    - @b ACTION_RESULT_IO_ERROR Not currently used.

  To make matters more complicated, it's possible if the result is
  ACTION_RESULT_DONE that state machine deallocated itself on the
  reentrant callback. Thus, state machine implementers MUST either
  use a scheme to never deallocate their machines on reentrant
  callbacks OR immediately check the returned action when creating
  an asynchronous task and if it is ACTION_RESULT_DONE neither read
  nor write any state variables. With either method, it's imperative
  that the returned action always be checked for special values and
  the value handled accordingly.

  Allocation policy:

  Actions are allocated by the Processor performing the actions.
  It is the processor's responsbility to handle deallocation once
  the action is complete or cancelled. A state machine MUST NOT
  access an action once the operation that returned the Action has
  completed or it has cancelled the Action.
