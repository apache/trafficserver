For comprehensive documentation on writing autests for Apache Traffic Server, see:

**doc/developer-guide/testing/autests.en.rst**

Most test coverage comes from end to end autests in tests/gold_tests. Of these,
most should be writting using ATSReplayTest with the configuration and traffic
specification in the associated replay.yaml file.
